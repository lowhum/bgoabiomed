Group ANC (GANC) provides an alternative, person-centered approach where pregnant women of similar gestational age meet with the same health provider for facilitated discussion. F studies show associations between GANC and various outcomes.  We employed a pre-post quasi-experimental design using mixed methods to assess a GANC model (Lea Mimba Pregnancy Clubs) at six health facilities in Kakamega County, Kenya. Between April 2018 and January 2019, we tracked 1652 women assigned to 162 GANC cohorts. Using an intention-to-treat approach, we conducted baseline (N\xa0= 112) and endline surveys (N\xa0= 360) with women attending immunization visits to assess outcomes including experience of care, empowerment and self-efficacy, knowledge of healthy practices and danger signs, and practice of healthy behaviors, including ANC retention. At endline, we conducted 29 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and three focus group discussions with women who were currently and previously participating in GANC, and 15 IDIs with stakeholders.  The proportion of survey respondents with knowledge of three or more danger signs during pregnancy more than tripled, from 7.1% at baseline to 26.4% at endline (OR: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.26–10.61). We also found improvements in women’s reports about their experience of care between baseline and endline, particularly in their assessment of knowledge and competence of health workers (OR: 2.52 95% CI: 1.57–4.02), respect shown by ANC providers (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.16–2.85), and women’s satisfaction with overall quality of care (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.03–2.53). We saw an increase from 58.9% at baseline to 71.7% at endline of women who strongly agreed that they shared their feelings and experiences with other women (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.1–2.7). The mean number of ANC visits increased by 0.89 visits (95% CI: 0.47–1.42) between baseline (4.21) and endline (5.08). No changes were seen in knowledge of positive behaviors, empowerment, self-efficacy, and several aspects related to women’s experience of care and adoption of healthy behavior constructs. Qualitatively, women and stakeholders noted improved interactions between health providers and women, improved counseling, increased feelings of empowerment to ask questions and speak freely and strengthened social networks and enhanced social cohesion among women.  GANC offers promise for enhancing women’s experience of care by providing improved counseling and social support. Additional research is needed to develop and test measures for empowerment, self-efficacy, and experience of care, and to understand the pathways whereby GANC effects changes in specific outcomes.', 'This study aims to investigate, retrospectively, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory results, radiologic findings, and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with transfusion-dependent β thalassemia major (TM), β-thalassemia intermedia (TI) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Design: A total of 17 Centers, from 10 countries, following 9,499 patients with hemoglobinopathies, participated in the survey. Main outcome data: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 were collected from medical records and summarized.  A total of 13 patients, 7 with TM, 3 with TI, and 3 with SCD, with confirmed COVID-19, were identified in 6 Centers from different countries. The overall mean age of patients was 33.7±12.3 years (range:13-66); 9/13 (69.2%) patients were females. Six patients had pneumonia, and 4 needed oxygen therapy. Increased C-reactive protein (6/10), high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 6/10), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 6/10) were the most common laboratory findings. 6/10 patients had an exacerbation of anemia (2 with SCD). In the majority of patients, the course of COVID-19 was moderate (6/10) and severe in 3/10 patients. A 30-year-old female with TM, developed a critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by death in an Intensive Care Unit. In one Center (Oman), the majority of suspected cases were observed in patients with SCD between the age of 21 and 40 years. A rapid clinical improvement of tachypnea/dyspnea and oxygen saturation was observed, after red blood cell exchange transfusion, in a young girl with SCD and worsening of anemia (Hb level from 9.2 g/dl to 6.1g/dl).  The data presented in this survey permit an early assessment of the clinical characteristics of COVID 19 in different countries. 70% of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 required hospitalization. The presence of associated co-morbidities can aggravate the severity of COVID- 19, leading to a poorer prognosis irrespective of age.', 'Self-management of long term conditions can promote quality of life whilst delivering benefits to the financing of health care systems. However, rarely are the meso-level influences, likely to be of direct relevance to these desired outcomes, systematically explored. No specific international guidelines exist suggesting the features of the most appropriate structure and organisation of health care systems within which to situate self-management approaches and practices. This review aimed to identify the quantitative literature with regard to diabetes self-management arrangements currently in place within the health care systems of six countries (The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Bulgaria, and Greece) and explore how these are integrated into the broader health care and welfare systems in each country.;  This review is based on results which are derived from a total of at least 5,500 individuals residing in the six participating countries. It indicates a policy shift towards patient-centred self-management of diabetes in a primary care context. The professional role of diabetes specialist nurses, the need for multidisciplinary approaches and a focus on patient education emerge as fundamental principles in the design of relevant programmes. Socio-economic circumstances are relevant to the capacity to self-manage and suggest that any gains and progress will be hard to maintain during economic austerity. This realist review should be interpreted within the wider context of a whole systems approach regarding self-care support and chronic illness management.;  The methodology for a realist review was followed. Publications of interest dating from 2000 to 2013 were identified through appropriate MeSH terms by a systematic search in six bibliographic databases. A search diary was maintained and the studies were assessed for their quality and risk of bias.;  Following the multi-step search strategy, 56 studies were included in the final review (the majority from the UK) reporting design methods and findings on 21 interventions and programmes for diabetes and chronic disease self-management. Most (11/21, 52%) of the interventions were designed to fit within the context of primary care. The majority (11/21, 52%) highlighted behavioural change as an important goal. Finally, some (5/21, 24%) referred explicitly to Internet-based tools.']"

Here, we assessed the effects of a long-term water deficit stress simulated on a precision phenotyping system on some morphological criteria and metabolite traits, as well as the expression of drought associated transcriptional factors of two contrasting drought-responsive African wheat cultivars, Condor and Wadielniel. The current study showed that under drought stress Wadielniel exhibits significant higher tillering and height compared to Condor. Further, we used gas chromatography and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry to identify compounds that change between the two cultivars upon drought. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that 50 metabolites with a possible role in drought stress regulation were significantly changed in both cultivars under water deficit stress. These metabolites included several amino acids, most notably proline, some organic acids, and lipid classes PC 36:3 and TAG 56:9, which were significantly altered under drought stress. Here, the results discussed in the context of understanding the mechanisms involved in the drought response of wheat cultivars, as the phenotype parameters, metabolite content and expression of drought associated transcriptional factors could also be used for potential crop improvement under drought stress.', 'Determining the genetic diversity and population structure of the modern hexaploid wheat varieties currently grown in Bulgaria is fundamental for selection of genotypes with desirable traits resilient under climatic fluctuations and development of successful crop improvement programmes. In this study, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to characterize a population of 117 modern wheat varieties (Triticum aestivum L.) from Bulgaria and several Western, Central and Eastern European countries. The genetic diversity was higher in the Western and Central European varieties than in the Bulgarian and the remaining Eastern European ones. Model-based population structure analysis defined 2 sub-populations (K = 2) dividing the Central and Western European varieties from the Bulgarian ones. Subsequent genetic structure analysis at K = 3 revealed an additional separation of the Bulgarian varieties in two distinct sub-populations. The phenotypic diversity among the varieties was evaluated in the fields of Dobrudzha Agricultural Institute, G. Toshevo in North-Eastern Bulgaria for three consecutive years. The distribution of the varieties in the biplot analysis in terms of grain yield and its components revealed differences in their adaptation to the agro-climatic conditions of North Bulgaria according to their geographical origin. These results and the prevalence of specific SSR alleles in the sub-populations suggest distinct adaptive mechanisms to specific agro-ecological regions. The data will be of interest for both breeders and farmers and could serve as a basis for wheat improvement programmes and further association mapping for important agronomic traits expressed under different environmental conditions. Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2021.1996274.', 'The phenotypic variation in osmotic adjustment (OA) capacity of five Bulgarian winter durum wheat genotypes and their progenies was determined using a modified method based on the measurement of seedling growth suppression after threeday exposure to osmotic stress induced by 1 mol/L sucrose. The genetic parameters of the studied trait in a diallel crossing scheme, including the selected genotypes and the microsatellite polymorphism at 43 loci, were determined. The old Bulgarian cultivar Apulicum 233 and all hybrid combinations involving this genotype showed higher OA. In the heritability of osmoregulation ability, the non-additive gene effects (specific combining ability) strongly predominated over the additive ones and had a significant impact on the observed high heterosis effect. Distinct polymorphisms were identified between the studied genotypes. Cluster analysis of the phenotypic data obtained from a multiyear test under water-limited conditions and the molecular data, both based on Euclidean distance, showed similar grouping of the genotypes with specific separation of cultivar Apulicum 233 (high OA) in a single cluster. Principal component analysis revealed not only interrelationships between the important agronomic and morpho-physiological traits in Bulgarian durum wheat under water-limited conditions, but also presence of relations between them and some microsatellite loci located near or within known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits. Further studies based on segregating population between genotypes with contrasting levels of OA will allow mapping QTLs for phenotypic traits expressed under water deficit and isolation of genes that can be used as potential markers in marker-assisted selection for drought tolerance.']"

Achillea spp. is widely used as nutraceuticals and food. In this study, chemical composition of essential oils, mineral composition, and antioxidant activities of different parts of A. collina were investigated. Flavonoids and polyphenols were detected using total flavonoid and polyphenolic contents assays. The Antioxidant activities were identified using 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP), and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) assays. The essential oil chemical compositions were determined by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. According to the results, the most active plant part was A. collina leaves with a value of IC50=62.32±1.53 μg/mL. The highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents (171.66±0.47 mg GAE /g and 8.50±0.43mg QE/g) were found in leaf parts. The essential oil was only obtained from the flower part of the plant. Besides, the major components found in A. collina were 1,8-cineole, camphor, β-linalool, γ- terpinene, γ-terpineol, α-pinene, epi-cyclocolorenone, epi-cyclocolorenone, and p-cymene. The results revealed that leaf samples of A. collina obtained from Bulgarian flora had higher antioxidant effect. The highest macro and microelement contents were Potassium (K)>Calcium (Ca)>Manganese (Mn)>Phosphor (P)>Magnesium (Mg)>Sodium (Na)> Copper (Cu)> Iron (Fe)> Boron (B), respectively.', 'Within this particular framework, the extracts obtained from Inula sarana using a variety of solvents, included n-hexane, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane (DCM), 70% ethanol, ethanol, and water. The extracts obtained from n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and DCM were then subjected to a specific method for their incorporation into β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The establishment of complex formation was validated through the utilization of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The identification of phytochemical components was executed using UHPLC-HRMS. Furthermore, the total phenolic and flavonoid content was evaluated using the Folin–Ciocalteu assay and the AlCl3 method. Subsequently, the determination of antioxidant capacity was conducted utilizing DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC, Frap, PBD, and MCA assays. The enzyme inhibitory activities of the samples (extracts and β-CD complexes) were also examined by AChE, BChE, tyrosinase, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase. The findings indicated that water and 70% ethanol extracts contained the highest phenolic content. One hundred and fourteen bioactive compounds were identified by UHPLC-HRMS analysis. This study unveiled a substantial array of flavonoids, phenolic acid-hexosides and caffeoylhexaric acids within I. sarana, marking their initial identification in this context. Among the various extracts tested, the 70% ethanol extract stood out due to its high flavonoid content (jaceosidin, cirsiliol, and eupatilin) and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acid hexosides. This extract also displayed notably enhanced antioxidant activity, with ABTS, CUPRAC, and FRAP test values of 106.50 mg TE/g dry extract, 224.31 mg TE/g dry extract, and 110.40 mg TE/g, respectively. However, the antioxidant values of the complex extracts with β-CD were generally lower than those of the pure extracts, an observation warranting significant consideration. In terms of enzyme inhibition activity, the ethanol and 70% ethanol extracts exhibited higher inhibitory effects on AChE, tyrosinase, and α-glucosidase. Conversely, n-hexane displayed stronger inhibitory activity against BChE. The ethyl acetate extract demonstrated elevated amylase inhibitory activity. However, the antioxidant values of the complex extracts with β-CD were generally lower than those of the pure extracts, a noteworthy observation, while water and extracts from the I. sarana complex with β-CD exhibited minimal or negatable inhibitory activity against specific enzymes.', 'The present study investigated Haberlea rhodopensis Friv. - a less-explored Balkan endemic plant. The purpose was to determine the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of alcohol extracts derived from the leaves of H. rhodopensis Friv. by applying reliable methods. The phenolic concentration in the examined extracts, calculated as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g leaf dry weight (DW), ranged from 99.03 to 151.24mg GAE/g DW. The results from the total phenolics assay and the antioxidant activity tests were significantly correlated. The methanol and 70% ethanol extracts, which had the highest total phenolic content values (151.24 and 150.67mg GAE/g DW, respectively), ranked the highest radical scavenging activity according to the 2,2′-azino-bis-3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid assay (1.451 and 1.343 mMTE/g DW, respectively). The major phenolic acids and some flavonoid aglycones and glycosides were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Luteolin (2,706.20μg/g DW), hesperidin (2,641.46μg/g DW), sinapic acid (1,296.78μg/g DW) and ferulic acid (619.80μg/g DW) were predominant in the H. rhodopensis 70% alcohol extract. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The research yielded novel information about Haberlea rhodopensis, a less-explored endemic plant. The aim of the present study was to determine the antioxidant capacity of this resurrection plant with a focus on phenolic antioxidants rather than enzymes. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis was performed to quantify the major phenolic acids and flavonoids. The antioxidant potential of the extracts obtained was estimated using different approved methods. The results suggested the possibility of practical application of H. rhodopensis leaf extracts because of the established free radical-scavenging activity.']"

The benefit of other HF therapies may be modified by sex, but whether sex modifies the treatment effect and safety profile of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors remains unclear. Our analyses aim to assess the effect of sex on the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin.  In a prespecified patient-level pooled analysis of DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure) and DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure), clinical outcomes were compared by sex (including the composite of cardiovascular death or worsening HF events, cardiovascular death, all-cause death, total events [first and recurrent HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death], and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores) across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction.  Of a total of 11 007 randomized patients, 3856 (35%) were women. Women with HF were older and had higher body mass index but were less likely to have a history of diabetes and myocardial infarction or stroke and more likely to have hypertension and atrial fibrillation compared with men. At baseline, women had higher ejection fraction but worse Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores than men did. After adjustment for baseline differences, women were less likely than men to experience cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.60-0.79]), all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.62-0.78]), HF hospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.72-0.94]), and total events (adjusted rate ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.71-0.84]). Dapagliflozin reduced the primary end point in both men and women similarly (Pinteraction=0.77) with no sex-related differences in secondary outcomes (all Pinteraction>0.35) or safety events. The benefit of dapagliflozin was observed across the entire ejection fraction spectrum and was not modified by sex (Pinteraction>0.40). There were no sex-related differences in serious adverse events, adverse events, or drug discontinuation attributable to adverse events.  In DAPA-HF and DELIVER, the response to dapagliflozin was similar between men and women. Sex did not modify the treatment effect of dapagliflozin across the range of ejection fraction.', 'The selective cardiac myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil has been shown to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. Its effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. We randomly assigned 8256 patients (inpatients and outpatients) with symptomatic chronic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 35% or less to receive omecamtiv mecarbil (using pharmacokinetic-guided doses of 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg twice daily) or placebo, in addition to standard heart-failure therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of a first heart-failure event (hospitalization or urgent visit for heart failure) or death from cardiovascular causes. During a median of 21.8 months, a primary-outcome event occurred in 1523 of 4120 patients (37.0%) in the omecamtiv mecarbil group and in 1607 of 4112 patients (39.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.99; P = 0.03). A total of 808 patients (19.6%) and 798 patients (19.4%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.11). There was no significant difference between groups in the change from baseline on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score. At week 24, the change from baseline for the median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was 10% lower in the omecamtiv mecarbil group than in the placebo group; the median cardiac troponin I level was 4 ng per liter higher. The frequency of cardiac ischemic and ventricular arrhythmia events was similar in the two groups. Among patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection, those who received omecamtiv mecarbil had a lower incidence of a composite of a heart-failure event or death from cardiovascular causes than those who received placebo.

In this phase 3, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 4744 patients with New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure) or cardiovascular death. Over a median of 18.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 386 of 2373 patients (16.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 502 of 2371 patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). A first worsening heart failure event occurred in 237 patients (10.0%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 326 patients (13.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.83).

The study examined COVID-19 immunisation coverage, behaviours, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines among students in Bulgarian medical universities. A prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken in September 2021- January 2022. Demographics, university programme, year of study, general vaccine attitudes and behaviour, and personal experience with COVID-19 and vaccines were collected. The chi-square test was used to test for associations and binominal logistic regression to identify possible predictors for vaccination. A total of 3050 students with a median age of 22 years, predominantly female participated. Three-quarters of the students (73.5%) have been vaccinated against COVID-19. An association was found between COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination in the previous season (χ2\xa0=\xa067.15, p < 0.001) as well as the intention to receive the flu vaccine in the current season (χ2\xa0=\xa0142.83, p < 0.001). Vaccine hesitation mainly stemmed from fear of side effects and safety concerns, but non-vaccinated students voiced them more often. Respondents who were less likely to be vaccinated considered themselves to have: (a) limited access to sufficient information to allow them to make an informed decision to vaccinate against COVID-19; (b) lack of public awareness and education campaigns about COVID-19 vaccines; (c) insufficient information about COVID-19 vaccines during university education that would allow them to make an informed decision to vaccinate; and (d) had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Informational initiatives that emphasise vaccine safety will boost COVID-19 immunisation coverage.', 'COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to spread globally, with vaccines being the most effective way to control the pandemic. Studies show a significant reduction in infection, hospitalisations, severe disease, and death after vaccination. The aim of the study was to determine the share of breakthrough infections among critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital at the beginning of the delta-variant pick. Material and methods: For a period of 10 months a total of 740 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, were treated in the intensive care unit of the University Hospital “St. Marina-Varna”, with ersons. Information on the vaccination status of all 740 hospitalised patients was extracted from the National information system ""Register of immunized persons against COVID-19"", including the type and date of COVID-19 vaccine administration, where available. After that, descriptive statistics were performed with the collected data.  Out of 740 patients, 19 (2.6%) had received at least 1 dose of vaccine, and 721 (97.4%)-none. Only ten (1.35%) of the studied everely and critically ill patients had completed the vaccination cycle (without a booster dose).  Our findings show that when fully administered, vaccines are highly effective against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to ICU admission. Our findings reinforce the value of widespread COVID-19 vaccination, underscore the importance of completing the vaccination cycle for either of the mRNA-based vaccines, and may help motivate persons who remain hesitant about being vaccinated.', 'The entire world has been suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since March 11, 2020. More than a year later, the COVID-19 vaccination brought hope to control this viral pandemic. Here, we review the unknowns of the COVID-19 vaccination, such as its longevity, asymptomatic spread, long-term side effects, and its efficacy on immunocompromised patients. In addition, we discuss challenges associated with the COVID-19 vaccination, such as the global access and distribution of vaccine doses, adherence to hygiene guidelines after vaccination, the emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, and vaccine resistance. Despite all these challenges and the fact that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unclear, vaccines have brought great hope for the world, with several reports indicating a significant decline in the risk of COVID19-related infection and hospitalizations.']"

They were evaluated using real time PCR for periodontal pathogens from the red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia). One month after therapy in the control group PPD decreased from 4.59 mm to 3.36 mm, the CAL gain was 1.09 mm and the reduction of bleeding and plaque - from 87.9% to 33.7% and from 75.9% to 40.9%, respectively. In the test group PPD de-creased from 4.58 mm to 3.15 mm, the CAL gain was 1.37mm and the reduction of bleeding and plaque was from 85.6% to 25.9% one month after the treatment. The results were statistically significant in favour of the laser group (p 〈 0.05). Microbio-logical analysis revealed that the pathogens from the red complex decreased 3 times in the control and 6 times in the test group. Therefore, the Er:YAG laser demonstrate pronounced early effectiveness in chronic periodontitis treatment and would be appro-priate alternative of the conventional periodontal therapy.', ""When providing dental care to children with a high level of dental anxiety, the range of approaches is divided into two sections: use of behaviour management techniques (BMTs) and application of alternative methods for caries removal. In an attempt to reduce dental anxiety, they can be mixed and matched in accordance with the dentists' choice. Owing to its promoted advantages, erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Er:YAG) laser turns into an ideal alternative technique for hard dental tissue therapy in anxious paediatric patients. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of a modified version of the BMT Latent inhibition' in combination with Er:YAG laser for achieving a reduction of dental anxiety in paediatric dental patients. and analysis This is a protocol for a randomised controlled clinical trial. The participants will be children aged 6-9 years, requiring conservative treatment of occlusal carious lesion on a second primary molar. Patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental or control group via a computer-generated sequence. In both groups, Latent inhibition' will be used as an anxiety-management technique. In the experimental group, caries treatment will be performed with Er:YAG laser, whereas that in the control group it will be performed with conventional rotary instruments. Outcome measures will be dental anxiety felt before and after the treatment, reported by the patient on a modified version of the Faces Scale by LeBaron et al., and the dynamics of heart rate, registered during the treatment session, which will be measured with a mobile pulse oximeter. Data will be analysed by independent sample t-test and paired t-test (pË 0.05).

Those clinical actions depend on three groups: parents/people who are with the child in the moment when trauma happens and give the first aid, dental specialist-surgeon who replants the tooth/teeth, dental specialist-endodontist who takes care of the endodontic treatment and the long period after treatment for follow up and observation of the replanted teeth. The aim of the paper is to present the dental postoperative care in a couple of cases of children with trauma and replanted avulsed permanent incisors. Material and methods: We present four clinical cases of children who get 6 permanent upper incisors replanted. Replantation is made by the oral surgeon. Treatment and observation after replantation are made by dental specialists of pediatric dentistry and conservative dentistry. All 4 cases get 3 years follow up period.  After replantation of 2 central incisors with complete root development (first clinical case) the left one has developed a resorption of the root but the right one is in a stable condition. Replantation of 3 teeth with incomplete root development (second and third clinical cases) where the patients refer to specialized surgical care less than 60 minutes after injury and store the teeth in different ways lead to different clinical results. In the case of avulsed upper right incisor (second case), it is stored in milk and we observe revascularization followed by partial root canal obliteration. The tooth is scheduled for endodontic treatment. In the case of upper central incisors, both kept dry till replantation in the alveolus filled up with substitute bone, we observe fast root resorption which going to lead to early tooth loss. After replantation of the first upper incisor with open apex, stored in physiological solution for 5 hours and with delayed endodontic treatment (forth case) healing process is stable and the prognosis is good. Follow up period for all the replanted teeth has continued.  The presented clinical cases show that there is a lack of dental teams for complex treatment of children with avulsed teeth in Bulgaria. Dental specialists have no good information about recommended by IADT protocols (www.iadt-dentaltrauma.org), for the treatment of teeth undergoes avulsion during childhood. Parents of these children have no proper information about how to store the teeth which are avulsed and found immediately after trauma.']"

HEV is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are estimated 20 million HEV infections worldwide every year, leading to estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of HEV infection. The WHO estimates that HEV infection caused approximately 44,000 deaths in 2015, which represents 3.3% of mortality rates due to viral hepatitis. In low-income (LI) countries and lower-middle-income (LMI) countries, HEV is a waterborne infection induced by HEV genotype (gt) 1 and HEV gt 2 that cause large outbreaks and affect young individuals with a high mortality rate in pregnant women from South Asian countries and patients with liver diseases. HEV gt 3, HEV gt 4, and HEV gt 7 are responsible for sporadic infections with zoonotic transmission mainly through the consumption of raw or undercooked meat from different animals. Acute HEV infection is relatively asymptomatic or mild clinical form, in rare cases the disease can be moderate/severe clinical forms and result in fulminant hepatitis or acute liver failure (ALF). Furthermore, HEV infection is associated with extrahepatic manifestations, including renal and neurological clinical signs and symptoms. Pregnant women, infants, older people, immuno-compromised individuals, patients with comorbidities, and workers who come into close contact with HEV-infected animals are recognized as major risk groups for severe clinical form of HEV infection and fatal outcome. Chronic HEV infection can occur in immunocompromised individuals with the possibility of progression to cirrhosis.', 'Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the leading causes of acute viral hepatitis. Transmission of HEV mainly occurs via the fecal-oral route (ingesting contaminated water or food) or by contact with infected animals and their raw meat products. Some animals, such as pigs, wild boars, sheep, goats, rabbits, camels, rats, etc., are natural reservoirs of HEV, which places people in close contact with them at increased risk of HEV disease. Although hepatitis E is a self-limiting infection, it could also lead to severe illness, particularly among pregnant women, or chronic infection in immunocompromised people. A growing number of studies point out that HEV can be classified as a re-emerging virus in developed countries. Preventative efforts are needed to reduce the incidence of acute and chronic hepatitis E in non-endemic and endemic countries. There is a recombinant HEV vaccine, but it is approved for use and commercially available only in China and Pakistan. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate the necessity of applying a preventive vaccine and to create conditions for reducing the spread of HEV. This review emphasizes the hepatitis E virus and its importance for public health in Europe, the methods of virus transmission and treatment, and summarizes the latest studies on HEV vaccine development.', 'Acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is recognized as a zoonosis in several European countries. We describe the characteristics and outcomes of locally acquired acute HEV hepatitis. Methodology: A prospective study was conducted among adult patients with acute HEV hepatitis at the University Hospital in Plovdiv, South Bulgaria between January 2020 and May 2022. An acute HEV infection case was a patient with acute hepatitis and laboratory-confirmed anti-HEV IgM antibodies and/or HEV RNA in serum. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and outcomes were recorded.  A total of 46 patients were selected. Median age of 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50.8-74.3). 28 (60.87%) were male. 22 (47.83%) had comorbidities such as diabetes (15), liver cirrhosis (3), hepatitis B virus infection (2), and malignancies (2). Of the 46, 18 (39.13%) patients were viremic and, HEV genotype 3 was detected. The median (IQR) serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, platelet, and international normalized ratio levels were 992 (495.8-1714.3) U/L, 715 (262.5-1259.3) U/L, 204 (132.3-235.5) μmol/L, 204 (132.3-235.5) ×109 L, and 1.0 (0.89-1.19), respectively. Six patients with underlying liver diseases had severe hepatitis. A young patient with osteoarthritis progressed to acute liver failure and died. The persistent HEV infection was ruled out in 2 malignant patients who tested HEV RNA negative three months after discharge.  Acute HEV hepatitis is a diagnosis to consider after excluding other causes of acute viral hepatitis. A diagnostic workup should include timely testing for HEV to identify the most vulnerable to severe consequences.']"

This study aimed to explore the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of antimicrobial resistance in CRAB isolates (n = 73) from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in two university hospitals in Bulgaria (2018–2019). The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis. The resistance rates were as follows: imipenem, 100%; meropenem, 100%; amikacin, 98.6%; gentamicin, 89%; tobramycin, 86.3%; levofloxacin, 100%; trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, 75.3%; tigecycline, 86.3%; colistin, 0%; and ampicillin–sulbactam, 13.7%. All isolates harbored blaOXA-51-like genes. The frequencies of distribution of other antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were: blaOXA-23-like, 98.6%; blaOXA-24/40-like, 2.7%; armA, 86.3%; and sul1, 75.3%. The WGS of selected extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDR-AB) isolates (n = 3) revealed the presence of OXA-23 and OXA-66 carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases in all isolates, and OXA-72 carbapenemase in one of them. Various insertion sequencies, such as ISAba24, ISAba31, ISAba125, ISVsa3, IS17, and IS6100, were also detected, providing increased ability for horizontal transfer of ARGs. The isolates belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence types ST2 (n = 2) and ST636 (n = 1) (Pasteur scheme). Our results show the presence of XDR-AB isolates, carrying a variety of ARGs, in Bulgarian ICU settings, which highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance, especially in the conditions of extensive antibiotic usage during COVID-19.', 'Many studies report an increase in antimicrobial resistance of Gram - negative bacteria during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to evaluate the epidemiological relationship between carbapenem-resistant (CR) Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients in COVID-19 wards and to investigate the main mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in these isolates during the period April 2020-July 2021. A total of 45 isolates were studied: Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 37), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae complex (n = 4) and Escherichia coli (n = 2). Multiplex PCR was used for detection of genes encoding carbapenemases from different classes (blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-48). For epidemiological typing and analysis, ERIC PCR was performed. Two clinical isolates of E. cloacae, previously identified as representatives of two dominant hospital clones from the period 2014-2017, were included in the study for comparison. In the CR K. pneumoniae group, 23 (62.2%) carried blaKPC, 13 (35.1%) blaNDM, 10 (27.0%) blaVIM, and 9 (24.3%) were positive for both blaKPC and blaVIM. The blaKPC was identified also in the two isolates of K. oxytoca and blaVIM in all E. cloacae complex isolates. The two CR isolates of E. coli possessed blaKPC and blaOXA-48 genes. Epidemiological typing identified 18 ERIC profiles among K. pneumoniae, some presented as clusters of identical and/or closely related isolates. The carbapenem resistance in the studied collection of isolates is mediated mainly by blaKPC. During the COVID-19 pandemic intrahospital dissemination of CR K. pneumoniae, producing carbapenemases of different molecular classes, as well as continuing circulation of dominant hospital clones of multidrug-resistant E. cloacae complex was documented.', 'The more frequent usage of colistin resulted in an increase of colistin resistance due to lipopolysaccharide modifications. The aim of this study was to reveal the prevalence and mechanisms of colistin resistance among multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected in Bulgaria. One hundred multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were collected in a period between 2017 and 2018. Among them, 29 colistin resistant and 8 heteroresistant isolates were observed and further investigated. Clonal relatedness was detected by RAPD and MLST. arbapenemases, two component system phoQ/phoP, pmrA/B, and mgrB were investigated by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Among 37 colistin nonsusceptible isolates, we detected 25 NDM-1 producers. The isolates belonged mainly to ST11 (80%), and also to ST147, ST35, ST340, ST219 (1-2 members per clone). Nine colistin resistant isolates showed changes in mgrB. IS903B-like elements truncated mgrB in five isolates. In two isolates, premature stopcodon (Q30stopcodon) was observed and another two isolates did not amplify mgrB, possibly due to bigger deletion or insertion. No isolates showed phoQ/phoP and pmrA/B mutations except for pmrB (four isolates had R256G). All isolates with IS903B insertions belonged to ST11 clone. The mgrB alterations play major role in colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates studied in the current work. We report truncation of mgrB by IS903 like element in colistin resistant NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae ST11 clone in Bulgaria.']"

It affects both children and adults, but is the most common chronic condition among the former. While inhaled controller drugs stabilize the disease in most asthma patients, there are a certain number of people who suffer from severe asthma, which requires treatment escalation. Oral corticosteroids are usually added, but they are associated with various side effects that may limit their application. The introduction of biologicals targeting inflammatory mediators has opened a new era of asthma treatment highlighting the importance of patient characterization.  The RECOGNISE study sought to provide real-world insight into the characteristics of patients deemed eligible for biological therapy based on the judgment of the clinical investigator in primary and secondary care settings. Materials and methods: The RECOGNISE study was a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional, one-visit study to characterize those severe asthma patients who are considered eligible for biological therapy among asthma patients in primary and secondary care settings in Bulgaria. Female and male asthma patients over 18 years of age were enrolled at four sites across the country. Severe asthma diagnosis had to be in agreement with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines. Patients provided patient-reported outcomes on asthma control and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Investigators completed specifically designed electronic case report forms (eCRFs), which included demographics and medical history. Medical history included lung function, biomarkers, comorbidities, exacerbations, Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU), and prescribed asthma medication in the last 12 months as well as adherence to medication.  Ninety-two severe asthma patients were enrolled in the Bulgarian RECOGNISE study (females prevailing - 65.22%). The median age (range) at diagnosis was 40 (18, 74) years. Most patients were never-smokers (n=72, 78.26%). For eligible patients, the median total EOS blood count was 431.0 cells/μl (n=19) and the blood EOS percentage was 5.95% (n=64). Chronic OCS use (treatment maintenance with OCS for ≥50% of the previous year) was documented for 30.1% of eligible patients. The results from the Bulgarian RECOGNISE cohort show that 90.2% of the severe asthma patients from the primary and secondary care sites are eligible for treatment with the approved biologicals.  The current findings emphasize how crucial it is for patients with severe asthma to be monitored by an asthma specialist who can determine when it is time to switch to biologicals.', 'This study aims to evaluate clinical characteristics, quality of life and control of treatment and therapy satisfaction of patients with asthma in Bulgaria. A pilot study of Bulgarian patients with asthma selected by allergologists was performed. The predefined inclusion criteria were asthma diagnosis with at least 6 months of living with asthma and use of asthma medication. Patient characteristics, treatment, quality-of-life, control of asthma and therapy satisfaction were systematically assessed. A retrospective observational study was conducted among asthma patients in Sofia in 2019. A strict definition of asthma-based solely on physicians’ diagnosis was used. Allergologists from two national reference hospitals for asthma therapy selected asthma patients. Every third patient with asthma that visited the office within 5 months period, and that agreed to participate was selected for the study. Quality-of-life of patients was measured using the EQ5D Assessment Test, control of asthma was assessed using ATCQ and ATC tests. A total of 71 asthma patients were enrolled. Approximately 43.6% were male, 16.9% were smokers, occupational risk factors were low (4.22%), 25% had moderate and 38% had severe asthma. The mean scores of asthma control treatment were 16.92 ± 5.68. The group has relatively high percentages of severe asthma patients. The asthma was not well controlled. National asthma strategies should focus on prevention and early detection of the disease.', 'Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are well-characterized diseases, they can coexist in a given patient. The term asthma–COPD overlap (ACO) was introduced to describe patients that have clinical features of both diseases and may represent around 25% of COPD patients and around 20% of asthma patients. Despite the increasing interest in ACO, there are still substantial controversies regarding its definition and its position within clinical guidelines for patients with obstructive lung disease. In general, most definitions indicate that ACO patients must present with non-reversible airflow limitation, significant exposure to smoking or other noxious particles or gases, together with features of asthma. In patients with a primary diagnosis of COPD, the identification of ACO has therapeutic implication because the asthmatic component should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids and some studies suggest that the most severe patients may respond to biological agents indicated for severe asthma. This manuscript aims to summarize the current state-of-the-art of ACO. The definitions, prevalence, and clinical manifestations will be reviewed and some innovative aspects, such as genetics, epigenetics, and biomarkers will be addressed. Lastly, the management and prognosis will be outlined as well as the position of ACO in the COPD and asthma guidelines.']"

Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture may occur also as a result of long-term glucocorticoid treatment (GCT) of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Denosumab specifically inhibits the binding of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB to its ligand, thus preventing osteoclast activation and bone resorption. The efficacy and safety of denosumab, administered subcutaneously as 60 mg, once every six months for 12 months, were evaluated in 60 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) divided into two groups. The GCT group included 30 patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoid therapy and the non-GCT group included 30 patients that did not receive GCT. In the non-GCT group, the 12-month treatment with denosumab resulted in BMD increase of 6.1% and 2.8% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score increased by 13.1% and 5.6% in both, the lumbar spine and hip. A slight rise in the Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) of 0.3% was observed. Bone pain was markedly reduced by 56.2%. In the GCT group, denosumab therapy increased BMD with 5.8% and 2.3% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score of lumbar spine and hip significantly increased by 14.0% and 4.4%, and the TBS rose by 5%. Bone pain was reduced by 53.6%.

Conducting DXA scans in men in Bulgaria is important to determine the state of their bone health. The aim of the study was to assess the bone mineral density (BMD) and T-score of the lumbar spine and of the hip through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in men and to compare their values in different age groups. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI) were assessed in 359 men with a mean age of 56 years (yrs.) ± 14 yrs., BMD and T-score of the lumbar spine and femoral neck were also examined. Men are divided into the following age decades: 20-29 yrs., 30-39 yrs., 40-49 yrs., 50-59 yrs., 60-69 yrs., 70-79 yrs. and ≥ 80 yrs. Statistical program SPSS version 19.0 was used to access the data. The ANOVA test analyzes was applied to investigate if there are any statistically significant differences in BMD and T-score of the lumbar spine and femoral neck between the different age decades. 264 men were evaluated for total BMD of the lumbar spine and 95 men had results for BMD of the femoral neck. The mean total BMD of the lumbar spine differed significantly between the individual age decades in men (p = 0.000). The mean BMD values of the femoral neck did not differ significantly in the different age decades in men (p = 0.07). 34 of 264 men (12.9%) were diagnosed with lumbar spine osteoporosis and 13 out of 93 men (14%) were diagnosed with femoral neck osteoporosis. The data obtained show a widespread prevalence of osteoporosis among men with a predominance of low values of BMD on the axial skeleton in the age range between 60 and 79 years.', 'Low back pain is a common problem in athletes, especially women who practice strength sports or high impact sports. From a pathokinesiological point of view, core instability inevitably leads to pain and impaired function in the lumbar spine. Various studies have been conducted in an attempt to determine effective methods for conservative treatment of musculoskeletal dysfunction in the back. The majority of studies do not report high evidence or solution to the problem in long term. The present research aims to follow the effect of hypopressive exercise program and myofascial techniques for low back pain in women who practice strength sports. Methodology: The methodology of the study includes conducting functional studies and tests – Merl d’Aubigne and Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) for pain assessment; Shober and Lasseg test to evaluate range of movement of the lumbar region and manual muscle testing (MMT) for abdominal and back musculature. A contingent of 42 women who practice strength sports were recruited according to the indications of experimental therapy and randomly divided in two– experimental group (EG N=22) and control group (CG N=20). The complex therapy for the EG includes – Hypopressive exersice, position-release techniques (PRT) and muscle-energy techniques (MET). The CG received routine kinesitherapeutic exercise for abdominal and back muscle and massage. Every participant received four procedures per week for 10 consecutive weeks. Measurements and tests were done before and after treatment.  Mean values of Merl dÁubigne modified scale for dynamic pain assessment show 3.46±0.6 points before, 0.82±0.73 points after therapy for EG, and 3.5±0.61 points and 2.2±0.62 points respectively for the women of the CG. Mean values of pain threshold measured before the complex therapy for women of EG was 7.13±0.94mm before and 2.68±0.94mm after treatment and 7.70±0.86mm and 5.65±0.67mm for the women of CG. Shober test initially shows 12.52±0.14cm for EG and 14.93±1.82cm for the CG and finally increase to 12.8±1.36cm and 14.13±1.15cm respectively. MMT shows much stronger abdominal muscles in women of the EG. Data demonstrates statistically significant differences after treatment (p<0.05).  Pain symptoms decrease significantly, and the range of movement and functionality of the lumbar region improves. The abdominal and back muscles are much stronger which provides stability of the spine in the area. In addition to treatment, the therapy can be successfully used to prevent recurrences of the symptoms especially in women who practice strength sports.']"

SUMMARY ANSWER: The 23rd ESHRE report highlights the rising ART treatment cycles and children born, alongside a decline in twin deliveries owing to decreasing multiple embryo transfers; fresh IVF or ICSI cycles exhibited higher delivery rates, whereas frozen embryo transfers (FET) showed higher pregnancy rates (PRs), and reported IUI cycles decreased while maintaining stable outcomes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: ART aggregated data generated by national registries, clinics, or professional societies have been gathered and analyzed by the European IVF-Monitoring (EIM) Consortium since 1997 and reported in a total of 22 manuscripts published in Human Reproduction and Human Reproduction Open. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) from European countries are collected by EIM for ESHRE each year. The data on treatment cycles performed between 1 January and 31 December 2019 were provided by either national registries or registries based on initiatives of medical associations and scientific organizations or committed persons in one of the 44 countries that are members of the EIM Consortium. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING,  Overall, 1487 clinics offering ART services in 40 countries reported, for the second time, a total of more than 1 million (1 077 813) treatment cycles, including 160 782 with IVF, 427 980 with ICSI, 335 744 with FET, 64 089 with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), 82 373 with egg donation (ED), 546 with IVM of oocytes, and 6299 cycles with frozen oocyte replacement (FOR). A total of 1169 institutions reported data on IUI cycles using either husband/partner’s semen (IUI-H; n = 147 711) or donor semen (IUI-D; n = 51 651) in 33 and 24 countries, respectively. Eighteen countries reported 24 139 interventions in pre- and post-pubertal patients for FP, including oocyte, ovarian tissue, semen, and testicular tissue banking. MAIN AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In 21 countries (21 in 2018) in which all ART clinics reported to the registry 476 760 treatment cycles were registered for a total population of approximately 300 million inhabitants, allowing the best estimate of a mean of 1581 cycles performed per million inhabitants (range: 437–3621). Among the reporting countries, for IVF the clinical PRs per aspiration slightly decreased while they remained similar per transfer compared to 2018 (21.8% and 34.6% versus 25.5% and 34.1%, respectively). In ICSI, the corresponding PRs showed similar trends compared to 2018 (20.2% and 33.5%, versus 22.5% and 32.1%) When freeze-all cycles were not considered for the calculations, the clinical PRs per aspiration were 28.5% (28.8% in 2018) and 26.2% (27.3% in 2018) for IVF and ICSI, respectively. After FET with embryos originating from own eggs, the PR per thawing was at 35.1% (versus 33.4% in 2018), and with embryos originating from donated eggs at 43.0% (41.8% in 2018). After ED, the PR per fresh embryo transfer was 50.5% (49.6% in 2018) and per FOR 44.8% (44.9% in 2018). In IVF and ICSI together, the trend toward the transfer of fewer embryos continues with the transfer of 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 embryos in 55.4%, 39.9%, 2.6%, and 0.2% of all treatments, respectively (corresponding to 50.7%, 45.1%, 3.9%, and 0.3% in 2018). This resulted in a reduced proportion of twin delivery rates (DRs) of 11.9% (12.4% in 2018) and a similar triplet DR of 0.3%. Treatments with FET in 2019 resulted in twin and triplet DR of 8.9% and 0.1%, respectively (versus 9.4% and 0.1% in 2018). After IUI, the DRs remained similar at 8.7% after IUI-H (8.8% in 2018) and at 12.1% after IUI-D (12.6% in 2018). Twin and triplet DRs after IUI-H were 8.7% and 0.4% (in 2018: 8.4% and 0.3%) and 6.2% and 0.2% after IUI-D (in 2018: 6.4% and 0.2%), respectively. Eighteen countries (16 in 2018) provided data on FP in a total number of 24 139 interventions (20 994 in 2018). Cryopreservation of ejaculated sperm (n = 11 592 versus n = 10 503 in 2018) and cryopreservation of oocytes (n = 10 784 versus n = 9123 in 2018) were most frequently reported. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Caution with the interpretation of results should remain as data collection systems and completeness of reporting vary among European countries. Some countries were unable to deliver data about the number of initiated cycles and/or deliveries. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The 23rd ESHRE data collection on ART, IUI, and FP interventions shows a continuous increase of reported treatment numbers and MAR-derived livebirths in Europe. Although it is the largest data collection on MAR in Europe, further efforts toward optimization of both the collection and the reporting, from the perspective of improving surveillance and vigilance in the field of reproductive medicine, are awaited.

SUMMARY ANSWER Despite some fluctuations in the number of countries reporting data, while the overall number of ART cycles has continued to increase year by year, the pregnancy rates in 2011 decreased slightly to those reported in 2010, and the number of transfers with multiple embryos (3+) and the multiple delivery rates declined. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Since 1997, ART data in Europe have been collected and reported in 14 manuscripts, published in Human Reproduction. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Retrospective data collection of European ART data by the EIM Consortium for the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE); cycles started between 1 January and 31 December 2011 are collected on a yearly basis. The data are collected by National Registers, when existing, or on a voluntary basis by personal information. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING, From 33 countries (+2 compared with 2010), 1064 clinics reported 609 973 treatment cycles including: IVF 138 592, ICSI 298 918, frozen embryo replacement (FER) 129 693, egg donation (ED) 30 198, in vitro maturation 511, preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening 6824 and frozen oocyte replacements 5237. European data on intrauterine insemination (IUI) using husband/partner's semen (IUI-H) and donor semen (IUI-D) were reported from 861 IUI laboratories in 24 countries. A total of 174 390 IUI-H and 41 151 IUI-D cycles were included. MAIN AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In 17 countries where all clinics reported to the ART register, a total of 361 972 ART cycles were performed in a population of 285 million inhabitants, corresponding to 1269 cycles per million inhabitants. For all IVF cycles, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer were stable with 29.1 and 33.2%, respectively, and for ICSI, the corresponding rates also were stable with 27.9 and 31.8%, respectively. In FER cycles, the pregnancy rate per thawing increased to 21.3% if compared with previous years. In ED cycles, the pregnancy rate per fresh transfer decreased to 45.8% (47.4% in 2010) and increased to 33.6% (33.3% in 2010) per thawed transfer. The delivery rate after IUI-H decreased to 8.3 (8.9 in 2010), and to 12.2% (13.8% in 2010) after IUI-D. In IVF and ICSI cycles, 1, 2, 3 and 4+ embryos were transferred in 27.5, 56.7, 14.5 and 1.3% of cycles, respectively. The proportions of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI (added together) were 80.8, 18.6 and 0.6%, respectively, resulting in a total multiple delivery rate of 19.2% compared with 20.6% in 2010, 20.2% in 2009, 21.7% in 2008, 22.3% in 2007 and 20.8% in 2006. In FER cycles, the multiple delivery rate was 13.2% (12.8% twins and 0.4% triplets). Twin and triplet delivery rates associated with IUI cycles were 9.7/0.6% and 7.3/0.3%, following IUI-H and IUI-D treatment, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The method of reporting varies among countries, and registers from a number of countries have been unable to provide some of the relevant data such as initiated cycles and deliveries. As long as data are incomplete and generated through different methods of collection, results should be interpreted with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The 15th ESHRE report on ART shows a continuing expansion of the number of treatment cycles in Europe, with more than 600 000 cycles reported in 2011. Since 2006, the proportion of IVF to ICSI cycles has reached a plateau after a small decrease in 2009. Pregnancy and delivery rates after IVF remained relatively stable compared with 2010 and 2009. The pregnancy rate per aspiration in ICSI cycles declined for the first time by 0.9%. The multiple delivery rate is lower than ever before.

SUMMARYANSWER: Despite some fluctuations in the number of countries reporting, the overall number of ART cycles has continued to increase year by year, and while pregnancy rates in 2010 remained similar to those reported in 2009, the number of transfers with multiple embryos (three or more) further declined. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Since 1997, ART data in Europe have been collected and reported in 13 manuscripts, published in Human Reproduction. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective collection of European ART data by the EIM Consortium for ESHRE; data were collected from cycles started between 1st January and 31st December 2010 by the National Registries of individual European countries, or on a voluntary basis by personal information for European countries without a national registry. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING,  Out of 31 countries, 991 clinics reported 550 296 ART treatment cycles: IVF (125 994), ICSI (272 771), frozen embryo replacement (FER, 114 593), egg donation (ED, 25 187), in vitro maturation (493), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/preimplantation genetic screening (6399) and frozen oocyte replacements (4859). European data on IUI using husband/partner's semen (IUI-H) or donor semen (IUI-D) were reported from 22 and 19 countries, respectively. A total of 176 512 IUI-H (+8.4% compared with 2009) and 38 124 IUI-D (+30.4% compared with 2009) cycles were included. MAIN AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In 16 countries where all clinics reported to the national ART registry, a total of 267 120 ART cycles were performed in a population of 219 million inhabitants, corresponding to 1221 cycles per million inhabitants. For IVF, the clinical pregnancy rates per aspiration and per transfer increased to 29.2 and 33.2%, respectively, and for ICSI, the corresponding rates also increased to 28.8 and 32.0%, when compared with the rates of 2009. In FER cycles, the pregnancy rate per thawing was 20.3%; in ED cycles the pregnancy rate per fresh transfer was 47.4% and per thawed transfer 33.3%. The delivery rate after IUI-H was 8.9 and 13.8% after IUI-D. In IVF and ICSI cycles, one, two, three and four or more embryos were transferred in 25.7, 56.7, 16.1 and 1.5%, respectively. The proportions of singleton, twin and triplet deliveries after IVF and ICSI (combined) were 79.4, 19.6 and 1.0%, respectively, resultinginatotal multiple delivery rateof 20.6% compared with 20.2% in 2009, 21.7% in 2008, 22.3% in 2007, 20.8% in 2006. In FER cycles, the multiple delivery rate was 12.8% (12.5% twins and 0.3% triplets). Twin and triplet delivery rates associated with IUI cycles were 9.6/0.5 and 8.5/0.2%, following treatment with husband and donor semen, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The method of reporting is not standardized in Europe but varies among countries. Furthermore registries from a number of countries have been unable to provide some of the relevant data such as initiated cycles and deliveries. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The 14th ESHRE report on ART and IUI treatments shows a continuing expansion of the number of ART treatment cycles in Europe, with more than half a million of cycles reported in 2010. The use of ICSI may have reached a plateau. When compared with 2009/2008, pregnancy and (multiple) delivery rates after IVF and ICSI remained relatively stable. The number of multiple embryo transfers (three or more embryos) has shown a decline. study funding/competing interests: The study has no external funding; all costs are covered by ESHRE.

Second, we explored a link between the SWB and their personal (self-efficacy) and social resources (social support) after controlling for sociodemographics, work characteristics, and COVID-19-related distress.  In total, 2915 psychotherapists from 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Great Britain, Serbia, Spain, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and Switzerland) participated in this study. The participants completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (I-PANAS- SF), the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.  Cognitive well-being (CWB; satisfaction with life) was a more country-dependent component of SWB than affective well-being (AWB). Consequently, at the individual level, significant correlates were found only for AWB but not for CWB. Higher AWB was linked to being female, older age, higher weekly workload, and lower COVID-19-related distress. Self-efficacy and social support explained AWB only, including their main effects and the moderating effect of self-efficacy.  The results highlight more individual characteristics of AWB compared to CWB, with a more critical role of low self-efficacy for the link between social support and PA rather than NA. This finding suggests the need for greater self-care among psychotherapists regarding their AWB and the more complex conditions underlying their CWB.', 'Although childhood is a critical period of development during which all children begin a lifelong process of self-discovery that shapes their identities, few studies have focused on the self-concept and self-esteem of young, gifted children. This study recruited 108 gifted children aged 5–6 years from Greece and their preschool teachers to explore the relationships among cognitive ability, domain-specific self-concepts, and global self-esteem. The Pictorial Scale for Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance was used to assess the domain-specific self-concepts of the participants, whereas behavioral manifestations of self-esteem were rated by the children’s teachers using the Behavioral Academic Self-Esteem Scale. There were positive correlations among IQ, perceived scholastic competence, and global self-esteem. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that significant predictors of global self-esteem were male gender, higher IQ, perceived scholastic competence, and perceived maternal acceptance. Additionally, there were gender differences in global self-esteem and perceived physical competence in favor of boys, whereas perceived maternal acceptance favored girls. This article discusses the need for practitioners working with gifted children to enact a comprehensive social–emotional learning curriculum in schools that promotes academic as well as personal and character strengths. Finally, the limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also presented.', 'This article presents a short research report on the relationship between perceived antagonism in social relations measured using the Belief in a Zero-Sum Game (BZSG) scale, life satisfaction, and positive and negative affect. Given that individuals who believe that life is like a zero-sum game are likely to perceive their daily interactions with others as unfair, we expected that individuals with high BZSG experience more negative affect and fewer positive one, resulting in a lower satisfaction with life. In addition, we examined whether country-level BZSG may play a moderating role in these associations. Data were collected from student samples (N = 7146) in 35 countries. Multilevel modelling revealed that perceived social antagonism in social relations is negatively associated with satisfaction with life and that this relationship is mediated by both positive and negative affect at the individual level. The relation of individual BZSG and negative affect on satisfaction with life were weaker in societies with higher country-level BZSG, suggesting that the effects of BZSG may be less detrimental in these countries. These findings extend previous knowledge about predictors of life satisfaction and suggest that social beliefs might also be an important factor that influences subjective well-being. The contribution of the study is that the separate treatment of life satisfaction and positive and negative affect may be helpful in many research situations, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective.']"

However, it is still challenging to design suitable nanocarriers that are able to load simultaneously anticancer drugs and nucleic acids due to their different physico-chemical properties. In the present work, an amphiphilic block copolymer comprising a biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block and a multi-alkyne-functional biodegradable polycarbonate (PC) block was modified with a number of poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) side chains applying the highly efficient azide–alkyne “click” chemistry reaction. The resulting cationic amphiphilic copolymer with block and graft architecture (MPEG-b-(PC-g-PDMAEMA)) self-associated in aqueous media into nanosized micelles which were loaded with the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer drug quercetin. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were further used to form micelleplexes in aqueous media through electrostatic interactions with DNA. The obtained nanoaggregates—empty and drug-loaded micelles as well as the micelleplexes intended for simultaneous DNA and drug codelivery—were physico-chemically characterized. Additionally, initial in vitro evaluations were performed, indicating the potential application of the novel polymer nanocarriers as drug delivery systems.', 'The present study describes the development of novel block copolymer nanocarriers of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), designed to enhance the solubility of the drug in water while achieving high encapsulation efficiency and prolonged drug release. Firstly, a well-defined amphiphilic block copolymer consisting of two outer hydrophilic polyglycidol (PG) blocks and a middle hydrophobic block of poly(ε-caprolactone) bearing pendant cinnamyl moieties (P(CyCL-co-CL)) were synthesized by the click coupling reaction of PG-monoalkyne and P(CyCL-co-CL)-diazide functional macroreagents. A non-modified polyglycidol/poly(ε-caprolactone) amphiphilic block copolymer was obtained as a referent system. Micellar carriers based on the two block copolymers were formed via the solvent evaporation method and loaded with CBD following two different protocols—loading during micelle formation and loading into preformed micelles. The key parameters/characteristics of blank and CBD-loaded micelles such as size, size distribution, zeta potential, molar mass, critical micelle concentration, morphology, and encapsulation efficiency were determined by using dynamic and static multiangle and electrophoretic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Embedding CBD into the micellar carriers affected their hydrodynamic radii to some extent, while the spherical morphology of particles was not changed. The nanoformulation based on the copolymer bearing cinnamyl moieties possessed significantly higher encapsulation efficiency and a slower rate of drug release than the non-modified copolymer. The comparative assessment of the antiproliferative effect of micellar CBD vs. the free drug against the acute myeloid leukemia-derived HL-60 cell line and Sezary Syndrome HUT-78 demonstrated that the newly developed systems have pronounced antitumor activity.', 'The aim of this study was to develop casein-based nanoscale carriers as a potential delivery system for daunorubicin, as a pH-responsive targeting tool for acute lymphocytic leukemia. A coacervation technique followed by nano spray-drying was used for the preparation of drug-loaded casein nanoparticles. Four batches of drug-loaded formulations were developed at varied drug–polymer ratios using a simple coacervation technique followed by spray-drying. They were further characterized using scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD diffractometry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Drug release was investigated in different media (pH 5 and 7.4). The cytotoxicity of the daunorubicin-loaded nanoparticles was compared to that of the pure drug. The influence of the polymer-to-drug ratio on the nanoparticles’ properties such as their particle size, surface morphology, production yield, drug loading, entrapment efficiency, and drug release behavior was studied.

Cases without SMN1 mutations are subclassified according to phenotype. Spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity-predominant, is characterized by lower limb muscle weakness and wasting, associated with reduced numbers of lumbar motor neurons and is caused by mutations in DYNC1H1, which encodes a microtubule motor protein in the dynein-dynactin complex and one of its cargo adaptors, BICD2. We have now identified 32 patients with BICD2 mutations from nine different families, providing detailed insights into the clinical phenotype and natural history of BICD2 disease. BICD2 spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity predominant most commonly presents with delayed motor milestones and ankle contractures. Additional features at presentation include arthrogryposis and congenital dislocation of the hips. In all affected individuals, weakness and wasting is lower-limb predominant, and typically involves both proximal and distal muscle groups. There is no evidence of sensory nerve involvement. Upper motor neuron signs are a prominent feature in a subset of individuals, including one family with exclusively adult-onset upper motor neuron features, consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia. In all cohort members, lower motor neuron features were static or only slowly progressive, and the majority remained ambulant throughout life. Muscle MRI in six individuals showed a common pattern of muscle involvement with fat deposition in most thigh muscles, but sparing of the adductors and semitendinosus. Muscle pathology findings were highly variable and included pseudomyopathic features, neuropathic features, and minimal change. The six causative mutations, including one not previously reported, result in amino acid changes within all three coiled-coil domains of the BICD2 protein, and include a possible 'hot spot' mutation, p.Ser107Leu present in four families. We used the recently solved crystal structure of a highly conserved region of the Drosophila orthologue of BICD2 to further-explore how the p.Glu774Gly substitution inhibits the binding of BICD2 to Rab6. Overall, the features of BICD2 spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity predominant are consistent with a pathological process that preferentially affects lumbar lower motor neurons, with or without additional upper motor neuron involvement. Defining the phenotypic features in this, the largest BICD2 disease cohort reported to date, will facilitate focused genetic testing and filtering of next generation sequencing-derived variants in cases with similar features."", 'Autosomal recessive forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (ARCMT) are rare but severe disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Their molecular basis is poorly understood due to the extensive genetic and clinical heterogeneity, posing considerable challenges for patients, physicians, and researchers. We report on the genetic findings from a systematic study of a large collection of 174 independent ARCMT families. Initial sequencing of the three most common ARCMT genes (ganglioside-induced differentiation protein 1—GDAP1, SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats-containing protein 2—SH3TC2, histidine-triad nucleotide binding protein 1—HINT1) identified pathogenic mutations in 41 patients. Subsequently, 87 selected nuclear families underwent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and homozygosity mapping, followed by targeted screening of known ARCMT genes. This strategy provided molecular diagnosis to 22\xa0% of the families. Altogether, our unbiased genetic approach identified pathogenic mutations in ten ARCMT genes in a total of 41.3\xa0% patients. Apart from a newly described founder mutation in GDAP1, the majority of variants constitute private molecular defects. Since the gene testing was independent of the clinical phenotype of the patients, we identified mutations in patients with unusual or additional clinical features, extending the phenotypic spectrum of the SH3TC2 gene. Our study provides an overview of the ARCMT genetic landscape and proposes guidelines for tackling the genetic heterogeneity of this group of hereditary neuropathies.', 'and Inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) are a group of genetic disorders of the peripheral nervous system in which neuropathy is the only or the most predominant clinical feature. The most common type of IPN is Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Autosomal recessive CMT (ARCMT) is generally more severe than dominant CMT and its genetic basis is poorly understood due to high clinical and genetic diversity. Here, we report clinical and genetic findings from 56 consanguineous Turkish families initially diagnosed with CMT disease. We initially screened the GDAP1 gene in our cohort as it is the most commonly mutated ARCMT gene. Next, whole-exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping based on whole-exome sequencing (HOMWES) analysis was performed. To understand the molecular impact of candidate causative genes, functional analyses were performed in patient primary fibroblasts. Biallelic recurrent mutations in the GDAP1 gene have been identified in 6 patients. Whole-exome sequencing and HOMWES analysis revealed 16 recurrent and 13 novel disease-causing alleles in known IPN-related genes and 2 novel candidate genes: 1 for a CMT-like disease and 1 for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy. We have achieved a potential genetic diagnosis rate of 62.5% (35/56 families) in our cohort. Considering only the variants that meet the American College for Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, the definitive diagnosis rate was 55.35% (31/56 families). Discussion This study paints a genetic landscape of the Turkish ARCMT population and reports additional candidate genes that might help enlighten the mechanism of pathogenesis of the disease.']"

The SC's lipid matrix, arranged in a lamellar structure, is integral to its protective role. Our study explores the restoration effects of a multilamellar cream with an acidic pH compared to a basic placebo cream on skin physiology and its interaction with the skin microbiome after stress induction via tape stripping (TS). Materials and  In this double-blind study, 14 healthy participants aged 21–58 years were assessed pre- and post-tape stripping, followed by a 14 days application of a multilamellar test cream and a placebo cream with evaluations on days 7, 14 and 17 for sustained effects. Skin physiology was analysed in terms of epidermal barrier function, SC hydration and surface pH. The microbiome was analysed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq, with subsequent species identification.  Our study showed significant improvements in skin barrier repair and SC hydration with verum, particularly after 14 days of application, while both creams initially enhanced stratum corneum hydration. No significant changes in surface-pH were detected. The skin microbiome analysis revealed that TS slightly decreased alpha diversity, a trend that verum significantly reversed, enhancing diversity beyond baseline levels after 14 days. Overall, while both creams contributed to a broader microbial phyla diversity over time, no significant changes in the abundance of specific genera or species were noted between treatments. Discussion and  Our study delineates the efficacy of a pH-optimized multilamellar cream in enhancing epidermal barrier recovery and SC hydration post-sequential TS, in contrast to an unstructured basic placebo. Verum cream significantly improved skin barrier function and SC hydration at day 14, with sustained effects evident beyond the treatment period. Furthermore, the multilamellar formulation facilitated the restitution of cutaneous microbiome diversity, a key indicator of healthy skin ecology, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between barrier integrity and microbial composition. These findings underscore the importance of multilamellar emollient structures in dermatological therapeutics, with potential implications for the design of advanced skincare interventions that holistically support cutaneous resilience and homeostasis."", 'The multiple protective functions of the skin derive from the interactions between epithelial skin and immune cells as well as the commensal microbiota. Developed in the last trimester of intra-uterine life, the skin barrier adapts dynamically after birth. Specific differences in the structure and physiology have been disclosed between infant and adult skin. The stratum corneum of infants is thinner and structured by thicker corneocytes with a more anisotropic surface in comparison to adult skin. Lower levels of the natural moisturizing factor and its constituents, together with the increased protease activity in the epidermis result in dry baby skin and ongoing adaptation of the desquamation to the extra-uterine environment. Infant epidermis is characterized by an accelerated proliferation rate and clinically competent permeability barrier in term neonates, despite the higher baseline values of transepidermal water loss in infants. The skin surface of newborns is less acidic, which could increase susceptibility to diaper and atopic dermatitis. Immediately after birth, skin is colonized by commensal bacteria—a process dependent on the mode of delivery and of major importance for the maturation of the immune system. Skin bacterial diversity and dysbiosis have been related to different pathology such as atopic and seborrheic dermatitis. This paper focuses on the ongoing structural, functional and biochemical adaptation of the human skin barrier after birth. We discuss the interactions on the ‘skin barrier/ microbiota/ immune system’ axis and their role in the development of competent functional integrity of the epidermal barrier.', 'In the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, skin manifestations, if present, were not paid enough attention. Then, the focus moved toward the impact of the prolonged use of personal protective measures in both healthcare workers and patients. In the meantime, attention is increasingly paid to dermatology as a result of the concern for certain groups of dermatologic patients, including those whose condition may worsen by the thorough disinfection measures and those treated with immunosuppressants or immunomodulators. Following patients with psoriasis on biological therapy, as well as other inflammatory and autoimmune cutaneous disorders such as atopic dermatitis, pemphigus, pemphigoid diseases, and skin cancer provoked the interest of dermatologists. Finally, an intriguing question to the dermatologic society was whether skin changes during COVID-19 infection exist and what could be their diagnostic or prognostic value. Here, we summarize skin conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, patient information, and expert recommendations and give an overview about the registries launched to document skin changes during COVID-19, as well as details about certain patient groups infected with SARS-CoV-2, for example, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and autoimmune bullous diseases.']"

These recommendations could be referred to different subgroups of patients in different clinical stages as well as to patients with different initial characterisation (histological morphology) of the primary tumours. One step surgery is not a myth, even more, it could prove to be one of the best solutions for some patient collectives with advanced stages of melanoma. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 74-year old patient with a congenital medium sized melanocytic nevus, located directly above the lateral part of the elbow joint. In one month and a half, an achromatic nodular formation evolves with a diameter of 2.7 x 2.3 cm, prominent over the skin level, painful by palpation and spontaneously bleeding. By the anamnestic, clinical and dermoscopic findings the patient was diagnosed with nodular melanoma associated with a congenital medium sized melanocytic nevus. A primary excision with a field of safety 0.5 cm in all directions was performed. After confirmation of the primary diagnosis (tumour thickness 8 mm with no ultrasonographic detection of enlarged lymph nodes), seven days later are-excision was performed with an additional field of surgical safety of 1.5 cm in all directions.  In this case remains unclear the following question: For what reason a preoperative high-frequent ultrasonography (HFUS) is not recommended to be used as it will allow only one surgical excision with the elimination of a tumour with a safety field of 2cm in all directions? The enigma about the obstacles preventing such a rational optimisation of the current diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm in patients with melanomas remains unresolved. One step surgery for cutaneous melanoma is widely used in many countries although it continues to be considered as a matter of dispute for some experts. Once again, by a clinical case and the following analysis, we would like to focus the attention of the dermatosurgical community on this crucial and highly significant problem. Innovations are very often resulting from the simplicity of logic, which unfortunately is not always accepted appropriately.', 'The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC’s) skin melanoma surgical treatment recommendations from 2011 are characterised by a prima facie ""freedom of choice"" regarding how extensive should be the excisions for melanomas with tumour thickness up to 2 mm and melanoma in situ. It is unclear why the recommended surgical security margins vary between 0.5 and 1 cm for melanoma in situ, whereas for melanomas with a tumour thickness of up to 1.99 mm, the range of variation is also between 1 and 2 cm, without specifying when the surgical field should be broader and, narrower, accordingly. This ""uncertainty or lack of intent"" of the guilders often leads to the same surgical approach to melanomas at different stages, or to a different approach in cases of melanomas at the same stage, in contrast. Therefore, this should be defined as wrong, logically. CASE PRESENTATION: We present 3 patients with cutaneous melanomas, treated with similar fields of surgical security. Current issues, generated within the framework of melanoma’s surgery guided by the recommendations of the AJCC are also discussed. A new surgical approach in patients with melanoma is recommended, discussed for the first time in world literature. We hypothesize that the introduction of a certain recommendations for a 2 cm surgical field in all directions during the initial excision, combined with the parallel performance of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, will lead in fact to several important advantages: 1) avoiding of the secondary excision in at least 70% - 90% of the patients (depending on the tumor thickness), 2) minimizing the risk of lymphatic effusion change and misinterpretation of the sentinel lymph node biopsy’s results in patients with secondary excision; 3) optimization of the surgical team’s work; 4) minimizing the possibility of unprepared/uninformed personnel to take part in decisions for treating a specific disease such as skin melanoma, 4) facilitating the appropriate patients’ group selection at the appropriate stage when involving them in different studies, leading to equal leveling of the initial positions;  Whether the proposed approach will be subjected to a detailed discussion of AJCC’s expert’s remains currently unclear.', 'One step melanoma surgery is a new surgical approach by which specific groups of patients with cutaneous melanoma may be operated only by or within a single surgical session. Until now, the Bulgarian Society for Dermatologic Surgery (BULSDS) has presented models of clinical behaviour, in which preoperative measurement of tumour thickness in combination with echographic measurement of the locoregional lymph nodes could lead to the conduct of the so-called one-step melanoma surgery. Although this one step surgery currently does not fit in the recommended guidelines, it ensures compliance of the recommended boundaries of operational security while saving patients a repeated excision and relieves the healthcare institutions or the patients themselves financially. CASE REPORT: We at this moment present another case from the Bulgarian Society for Dermatologic Surgery (BULSDS) of one step melanoma surgery with a perfect end result, where the tumour thickness was not preoperatively determined by high-frequency echography. Preoperative assessment of tumour thickness was performed based on the clinical picture and dermatoscopy. The histologically established tumour thickness was identical to the preoperative assessment, i.e. <1 mm. Removal of the melanocytic lesion was performed with operational security field of 1cm in all directions, where, as a rule, no further removal of the draining lymph nodes is required.  Оne step melanoma surgery has two significant advantages: 1) it saves a re-excision in certain groups of patients, which in turn is 2) significantly more favourable from a financial point of view. Its applicability in the appropriate groups of patients and the postoperative (although in a limited number of patients) results achieved indicate the need to optimise the current algorithms and direct them individually to each patient. Guidelines may not and should not be unified or set strict limits given the fact that they show a significant level of variability themselves regarding some key moments in the initial surgical treatment of melanoma. More than 10% of the primary melanoma cases refer to thin melanomas, and dermatoscopy and clinics are a sufficient method of optimising the planned surgical excision.']"

However, data on how CAM contacts vary across countries, mental disorders and their severity, and health care settings is largely lacking. The aim was therefore to investigate the prevalence of contacts with CAM providers in a large cross-national sample of persons with 12-month mental disorders. In the World Mental Health Surveys, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was administered to determine the presence of past 12 month mental disorders in 138 801 participants aged 18-100 derived from representative general population samples. Participants were recruited between 2001 and 2012. Rates of self-reported CAM contacts for each of the 28 surveys across 25 countries and 12 mental disorder groups were calculated for all persons with past 12-month mental disorders. Mental disorders were grouped into mood disorders, anxiety disorders or behavioural disorders, and further divided by severity levels. Satisfaction with conventional care was also compared with CAM contact satisfaction. An estimated 3.6% (standard error 0.2%) of persons with a past 12-month mental disorder reported a CAM contact, which was two times higher in high-income countries (4.6%; standard error 0.3%) than in low- A nd middle-income countries (2.3%; standard error 0.2%). CAM contacts were largely comparable for different disorder types, but particularly high in persons receiving conventional care (8.6-17.8%). CAM contacts increased with increasing mental disorder severity. Among persons receiving specialist mental health care, CAM contacts were reported by 14.0% for severe mood disorders, 16.2% for severe anxiety disorders and 22.5% for severe behavioural disorders. Satisfaction with care was comparable with respect to CAM contacts (78.3%) and conventional care (75.6%) in persons that received both. CAM contacts are common in persons with severe mental disorders, in high-income countries, and in persons receiving conventional care. Our findings support the notion of CAM as largely complementary but are in contrast to suggestions that this concerns person with only mild, transient complaints. There was no indication that persons were less satisfied by CAM visits than by receiving conventional care. We encourage health care professionals in conventional settings to openly discuss the care patients are receiving, whether conventional or not, and their reasons for doing so.', 'Illicit drug use and associated disease burden are estimated to have increased over the past few decades, but large gaps remain in our knowledge of the extent of use of these drugs, and especially the extent of problem or dependent use, hampering confident cross-national comparisons. The World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys Initiative involves a standardised method for assessing mental and substance use disorders via structured diagnostic interviews in representative community samples of adults. We conducted cross-national comparisons of the prevalence and correlates of drug use disorders (DUDs) in countries of varied economic, social and cultural nature. and findings: DSM-IV DUDs were assessed in 27 WMH surveys in 25 countries. Across surveys, the prevalence of lifetime DUD was 3.5%, 0.7% in the past year. Lifetime DUD prevalence increased with country income: 0.9% in low/lower-middle income countries, 2.5% in upper-middle income countries, 4.8% in high-income countries. Significant differences in 12-month prevalence of DUDs were found across country in income groups in the entire cohort, but not when limited to users. DUDs were more common among men than women and younger than older respondents. Among those with a DUD and at least one other mental disorder, onset of the DUD was usually preceded by the ‘other’ mental disorder.  Substantial cross-national differences in DUD prevalence were found, reflecting myriad social, environmental, legal and other influences. Nonetheless, patterns of course and correlates of DUDs were strikingly consistent. These findings provide foundational data on country-level comparisons of DUDs.', 'The treatment gap between the number of people with mental disorders and the number treated represents a major public health challenge. We examine this gap by socio-economic status (SES; indicated by family income and respondent education) and service sector in a cross-national analysis of community epidemiological survey data. Data come from 16 753 respondents with 12-month DSM-IV disorders from community surveys in 25 countries in the WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative. DSM-IV anxiety, mood, or substance disorders and treatment of these disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Only 13.7% of 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI cases in lower-middle-income countries, 22.0% in upper-middle-income countries, and 36.8% in high-income countries received treatment. Highest-SES respondents were somewhat more likely to receive treatment, but this was true mostly for specialty mental health treatment, where the association was positive with education (highest treatment among respondents with the highest education and a weak association of education with treatment among other respondents) but non-monotonic with income (somewhat lower treatment rates among middle-income respondents and equivalent among those with high and low incomes). The modest, but nonetheless stronger, an association of education than income with treatment raises questions about a financial barriers interpretation of the inverse association of SES with treatment, although future within-country analyses that consider contextual factors might document other important specifications. While beyond the scope of this report, such an expanded analysis could have important implications for designing interventions aimed at increasing mental disorder treatment among socio-economically disadvantaged people.']"

This water ecosystem is located in a copper mining and metallurgical region. Water metal concentrations were significantly higher in the summer than in the spring (p<0.05). Moreover, As, Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations were higher than the national limits. Qualitative factors ""element"" and ""fish organ"" had a stronger influence on metal bioaccumulation than the factors ""season"" and ""fish species"". In fish, the highest metal levels were detected in the liver, spleen, kidney and gills, and the lowest in the dorsal muscle. Tissue levels were higher in the summer, but in general they were similar between the two Cyprinid fish. Fish muscles had the lowest metal levels at all times, but As and Pb exceeded the national and international standards. Therefore, we would not recommend fish consumption from Topolnitsa, as continuous metal contamination of the reservoir may seem to present human health risk.', 'Topolnitsa Reservoir is located in a region of Bulgaria rich in copper mines where intensive mining has been ongoing for several decades. General data on the ecological status of the reservoir and the effects of metal on fish is relatively scarce. The first aim of the study was to measure the concentrations of six metals (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in water samples and in the gills of European perch (Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1785.). The second objective was to examine gill structure and determine the severity of histological alteration as a result of metal exposure. Surface water and fish gill samples were collected in spring, summer and autumn in 2012 and metal and histological analyses were performed. Metal concentrations in the water samples varied, but only Cu concentrations were determined in all three seasons and they were higher than the maximum permissible levels. The concentrations of metals in the gills were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the water. Examination of gill structure revealed the presence of proliferative and degenerative changes, as well as changes in the blood vessels. Histological lesions were similar in their severity in all three seasons. This study provides the first information about metal effects on the morphology of European perch gills from Topolnitsa Reservoir. It can be concluded that the metal contamination of the Topolnitsa Reservoir and fish is chronic and that it can negatively affect the structure and function of fish gills. As metals display a tendency to accumulate in fish gills, their effects are expected to become more severe with time, as they affect gill functions.', 'The introduction of an integration approach for management of the water basins, including assessment and control of stream water quality and sediment quality, as well as regulation of the pollutant influx in the water receiver, is necessary. The changes in the microbial communities, as a response to the chronic discharge of untreated dairy wastewater, were followed in river and in depth, in three river components “stream water—sediment water—sediments”. The water quality of Leva River decreased after dairy wastewater discharge as the microbial communities reacted with structural and functional changes, related with enhancement of aerobic heterotrophs and the values of total dehydrogenase activity and phosphatase activity index. The result was a decrease of organic matter and nutrients in the stream water in Station 4. However, an improvement of river water quality was not ascertained according to the Bulgarian State Standard. The applied ecological theory for r/K- strategists showed that in the stream water the microbial community is presented with fast growing populations, while in the sediment water and sediments prevailed slow growing bacteria. In the sediments aerobic heterotrophs were with higher density and showed higher activities of total dehydrogenase, phosphatase and protease. The obtained results confirmed that microbial community in the sediment zone is an important factor for the regulation of the transformation processes of organic matter and nutrients in water and sediments, as well as for the formation of river water quality in water receiver.']"

The clinical assessment protocol was identical to the ACS and included an extensive questionnaire to enable direct comparisons to be made between the two groups.  The study population was predominantly female (66%) with a mean age of 76.3 (SD 9.9) years. New systemic and ocular disease affected 18.4% and 10.3% of subjects respectively, and 10.3% required referral to either a general practitioner (2.1%) or ophthalmologist (8.2%). Mean best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) was 0.2 (0.2) logMAR units (6/9 Snellen equivalent), with mean spherical equivalent -0.37 (1.01) dioptres (D) and astigmatism -1.07 (0.70) D 2 years postoperatively, compared to mean BSCVA 0.1 (0.2) logMAR units (6/7.5 Snellen equivalent), spherical equivalent -0.59 (1.07) D, and astigmatism -1.14 (0.77) D 4 weeks after surgery. 94.9% of subjects retained a BSCVA of 6/12 or better, irrespective of pre-existing ocular disease.

Materials and methods: Since 2010, we have treated 319 eyes of 164 prematurely born children for type 1 prethreshold retinopathy of prematurity and were prospectively followed up. The mean (range) gestational age was 28.6 weeks of gestation (23–33) and the mean (range) birth weight was 1143 g (570–1990). Cryotherapy was applied on 76 eyes (23.2%), laser was used in 215 eyes (65.5%), anti-VEGF – in 10 eyes (3%) and surgery – in 18 eyes (5.5%). Twelve children (24 eyes, 7.3%) were lost to the follow-up. BCVA was tested in 114 eyes and refraction in 190 eyes. Because of the small number of eyes treated surgically or with anti-VEGF (18 and 10, respectively), these children’s eyes were excluded from the statistical analysis.  Fifty eyes showed BCVA between 0.6 and 1.0; 25 eyes – between 0.2 and 0.5; 5 eyes – between 0.04 and 0.1; 5 eyes between light perception –0.03 and 4 eyes were totally blind. Laser-treated eyes showed statistically significantly higher BCVA compared to the cryotherapy treated eyes (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.012). Myopia (any myopic refraction) was found in 50 eyes; hyperopia (>+2 D) – in 20 eyes; astigmatism (difference between the two principal meridians >0.75 D) – in 70 eyes, and emmetropia – in 30 eyes. Although in the laser-treated group more eyes showed emmetropic and hyperopic refraction compared to cryo treated group (25 eyes vs. 7 eyes – emmetropia and 15 eyes vs. 5 eyes – hyperopia, respectively), the difference did not reach statistical significance (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.106).  Timely treatment of type 1 prethreshold retinopathy of prematurity leads to very good anatomical and functional results. Laser treatment leads to significantly higher BCVA, compared to cryotherapy. Emmetropia and hyperopia are more commonly seen in laser-treated eyes.', 'To investigate the effect of Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology tonometry (CST) on intraocular pressure (IOP). Design: Cohort study. Participants: Patients with and without primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) were included.  Intraocular pressure was measured using the Icare rebound tonometer (ICRT; Icare Finland Oy) and the biomechanically corrected IOP (bIOP) using the CST. Intraocular pressure was measured at baseline with ICRT, followed by a CST measurement in one eye with the fellow eye acting as a control. Icare measurements were repeated at 10 seconds and 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, and 60 minutes in both eyes. The ratio of test eye IOP to fellow eye IOP was used to control for intrasubject variation. Main Outcome Measures: Intraocular pressure change following Corneal Visualization Scheimflug Technology tonometry.  Forty participants (mean age, 54.09 ± 20.08 years) were included comprising 20 patients with POAG and 20 patients with no ocular abnormalities other than cataract. Mean central corneal thickness was similar in those without POAG (547.4 ± 55.05 μm) and with POAG (520.22 ± 37.59 μm; P = 0.14). No significant change was found in IOP measured with the ICRT in the fellow eye versus the 1-hour period in either the healthy (P = 0.87) or POAG (P = 0.92) group. Significant changes were found in IOP after CST measurement for both healthy (P < 0.01) and glaucomatous (P < 0.01) eyes. After the CST measurement, the IOP reduced continuously from a mean of 13.75 mmHg to 10.84 mmHg at 4 minutes for healthy eyes and from 13.28 mmHg to 11.11 mmHg at 8 minutes for glaucomatous eyes before approaching (83% for healthy eyes and 92% POAG eyes) the pre-CST measurement at 1 hour.  Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology tonometry causes a significant reduction in IOP in both glaucomatous and healthy eyes that lasts for at least 1 hour afterward.']"

It is well known that probiotics have a number of beneficial health effects in humans. They play an important role in protecting the host against harmful microorganisms, reduce metabolic disorders and support immune functions. In the present study, we investigated 26 probiotic products: 16 commercially available ones and 10 from a local manufacturer. None of the commercial products contained all labelled LAB and some of them contained unacceptable microorganisms. Of 890 isolated strains only 420 met the criteria for LAB. Ninety-seven strains were investigated by phenotypic and genotypic methods. 16S–23S rDNA amplification was performed for all putative LAB isolates. Fifty-seven rod-shaped bacteria referred to genus Lactobacillus and 16 coccus bacteria, to genus Weissela. Two-step multiplex PCR identified the rod-shaped strains to belong to four species: Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (three strains), Lactobacillus acidophilus (four strains), Lactobacillus casei (three strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (two strains), Lactobacillus reuteri (four strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (one strain). The transit tolerance of the isolated bacteria to in vitro simulated gastric juice (pH 2) was examined. Only four strains survived after 90 min of incubation. The antimicrobial activity of the native supernatants of the isolates was tested and 10 of them showed slight activity against three pathogenic bacteria. Our results demonstrated that only freshly produced products possessed the expected number of viable cells. The data revealed that one of the most common problems is the lower concentration of viable cells, misidentification and the presence of undesired microflora.', 'This study aimed to isolate and characterize viable lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the most popular in Bulgaria fermented milk products.

Eight of the strains from yoghurt were phenotypically similar to Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Other seven isolates from cheese and yoghurt were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, according to classical tests and API LAB profiles. Their species affiliation was confirmed by species-specific and multiplex PCR. The molecular- based methods allowed reclassifying two cheese isolates determined as L. paracasei. L. plantarum was the predominant species in cheese samples and referred as member of non-starter lactic acid bacteria. Two of the new isolated L. plantarum strains showed anti-E. coli activity.', 'A Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with high exopolysaccharide activity was selected from among 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains.

The associated cultivation of the lactobacteria and yeast had a positive effect on the exopolysaccharide activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1. The maximum exopolysaccharide concentration of the starter culture exceeded the one by the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 monoculture by approximately 1.7 times, and the time needed to reach the maximum concentration (824.3 mg exopolysacharides/1) was shortened by 6 h. The monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides from the kefir starter culture was represented by glucose and galactose in a 1.0:0.94 ratio, which proves that the polymer synthesized is kefiran.']"

In permeabilized cells, they can be extracted from nuclei by using salt concentration in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 M. Although other nuclear proteins are also extracted at 0.7 M salt, the remaining nucleus represents a template that is relatively intact.  A cytochemical method was used to study the affinity of reconstituted linker histones for chromatin in situ in cultured human fibroblasts. We also investigated their ability to condense chromatin by using DNA-specific osmium ammine staining for electron microscopy.  Permeabilized and H1-depleted fibroblast nuclei were suitable for the study of linker histone-chromatin interactions after reconstitution with purified linker histone subfractions. Our results showed that exogenous linker histones bind to chromatin with lower affinity than the native ones. We detected no significant differences between the main H1 and H1° histone fractions with respect to their affinity for chromatin or in their ability to condense chromatin.  Linker histone interactions with chromatin are controlled also by mechanisms independent of linker histone subtype composition.', 'Cellular DNA is constantly being damaged by numerous internal and external mutagenic factors. Probably the most severe type of insults DNA could suffer are the double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). They sever both DNA strands and compromise genomic stability, causing deleterious chromosomal aberrations that are implicated in numerous maladies, including cancer. Not surprisingly, cells have evolved several DSB repair pathways encompassing hundreds of different DNA repair proteins to cope with this challenge. In eukaryotic cells, DSB repair is fulfilled in the immensely complex environment of the chromatin. The chromatin is not just a passive background that accommodates the multitude of DNA repair proteins, but it is a highly dynamic and active participant in the repair process. Chromatin alterations, such as changing patterns of histone modifications shaped by numerous histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodeling, are pivotal for proficient DSB repair. Dynamic chromatin changes ensure accessibility to the damaged region, recruit DNA repair proteins, and regulate their association and activity, contributing to DSB repair pathway choice and coordination. Given the paramount importance of DSB repair in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, DSB repair has turned into an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer therapies, some of which have already entered the clinic.', 'Complex interactions among DNA and nuclear proteins maintain genome organization and stability. The nuclear proteins, particularly the histones, organize, compact, and preserve the stability of DNA, but also allow its dynamic reorganization whenever the nuclear processes require access to it. Five histone classes exist and they are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes. The linker histones are the fifth class and over time, their role in chromatin has been neglected. Linker histones interact with DNA and the other histones and thus sustain genome stability and nuclear organization. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a brilliant model for studying linker histones as the gene for it is a single-copy and is non-essential. We, therefore, created a linker histone-free yeast strain using a knockout of the relevant gene and traced the way cells age chronologically. Here we present our results demonstrating that the altered chromatin dynamics during the chronological lifespan of the yeast cells with a mutation in ARP4 (the actin-related protein 4) and without the gene HHO1 for the linker histone leads to strong alterations in the gene expression profiles of a subset of genes involved in DNA repair and autophagy. The obtained results further prove that the yeast mutants have reduced survival upon UVA/B irradiation possibly due to the accelerated decompaction of chromatin and impaired proliferation. Our hypothesis posits that the higher-order chromatin structure and the interactions among chromatin proteins are crucial for the maintenance of chromatin organization during chronological aging under optimal and UVA-B stress conditions.']"

The underlying issue is the lack of well-organized and functioning screening in general, but especially the lack of primary HPV screening.  To determine an adequate screening approach for the selection of patients with high-grade cervical lesions (HSIL/CIN 2-3) and the potential of colposcopic examination for the diagnosis of HSIL/CIN 2-3 Materials and  From September 2022 to June 2023, 55 patients underwent screening and diagnosing for all types of precancerous lesions at Prof. Kornovski Medical Centre. The age of patients with LSIL and HSIL was 20–49 (mean 35.6) and 18–72 (mean 36.1) respectively. The methods we used were: Alinity HR HPV test; PAP test; colposcopy; histological diagnosis made by targeted biopsy under colposcopic control or by LLETZ for cases in which HSIL in the cervical canal could not be excluded.  Patients with HSIL were HPV (-) in 10% and HPV (+) in 84%. Of the latter, 53.8% were HPV 16+. Cytological screening in HSIL patients revealed normal cytology in 19%, of which 83% were HPV (+) and of these, 80% were HPV 16(+), and 20% were (+) for HPV, including 31 and 33 strains. In 84% of histologically confirmed HSIL cases, colposcopy showed evidence of HSIL and in 13% (4 patients) – LSIL. In the latter, the diagnosis was made by excisional biopsy procedure (LLETZ). The indication and reason for loop excision was the HPV status of these patients –HPV16(+) in 67% and HPV18(+) in 33%. Cytology in these 4 patients was normal in 50% of cases.  The Alinity HR HPV test adequately stratified oncogenic strains according to their risk for HSIL. Patients who are HPV 45+, as well as the HPV (31, 33, 52, 58) (+) group, should be referred for colposcopy without an additional triage method or should be subject to closer follow-up (repeat test in 6 –12 months) before referral for colposcopy. Patients who are HPV 16+ and HPV 18+ should undergo mandatory expert colposcopy and biopsy, including excisional biopsy (LLETZ), in the absence of HSIL from the colposcopy-directed targeted punch biopsy. Patients who are positive for any of the HPV strains (35, 39, 51, 56, 59, 66, 68) may be referred for cytology and those with abnormal cytology – for expert colposcopy.', 'The aim of this study was to analyse the correlation between cases of human papillomavirus (HPV+/−) infection of the uterine cervix revealed through HPV typing and cytological results from Papanicolaou (Pap)-stained cervical smears. Cervical smears of 421 Bulgarian women attending routine gynaecological examinations during the three-year study period were stained by the Pap technique and classified by the Bethesda system. GenoFlow HPV Array Test Kit was used to analyse the HPV status in the collected cervical samples. The results showed that, of the 421 women, 177 (42%) were HPV(+) and 244 (58%) were HPV(−); 334 (79.3%) Pap smears were with normal morphology and 87 (20.7%) had high/low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL/HSIL) changes. Of the 87 women with LSIL/HSIL changes, 54% (47/87) were HPV(−) and 46% (40/87) were HPV(+). There was no statistically significant correlation between the HPV(+) status and the cytological LSIL/HSIL findings (P > 0.05). Koilocytes were found in 30.4% (128/421) of the samples. Of the 128 women with koilocytosis, 59.4% (76/128) were HPV(−) and 40.6% (52/128) were HPV(+). There was no significant correlation (P > 0.05) between the presence of koilocytes in cervical smears and HPV infection. Our results suggest that HPV infection is frequent even in women with negative Pap-smear results, and polymerase chain reaction seems to be the only reliable test to diagnose this infection. However, the results from this study cannot be considered to fully support the replacement of cytology and colposcopy examination in cervical cancer screening with HPV genotyping tests only.', 'Cervical carcinoma is a leading cause of mortality from cancer among women worldwide. Oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are recognised as causative agents of cervical cancer and its precursor, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It was shown that successful treatment of CIN results in clearance of HPV infection and treatment failure is accompanied by the detection of viral persistence. Therefore, follow-up testing for HPV of CIN treated patients is now accepted as an option for monitoring for recurrent disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of high risk HPV after treatment of Bulgarian women for high-grade CIN. Cervical specimens were obtained from 59 women treated for CIN by conization. They were subjected to Pap smear test and HPV DNA testing by PCR. Cytological abnormalities were found in 18.6% of all women. HPV DNA was detected in 91% of women with abnormal cytology. Only 8.3% of women with normal cytology were HPV positive. HPV genotyping showed that the most prevalent HPV type was HPV16 accounting for 80% of HPV positive samples with abnormal cytology and for 25% of HPV positive samples with normal cytology. HPV18 was detected only in one specimen with abnormal cytology. HPV31 was found in 50% of all HPV positive materials. We were not able to detect HPV33. Our study indicates that the posttreatment high risk HPV infection detected in Bulgarian women is a risk factor for subsequent cervical dysplasia and that the high risk HPV testing after conization is important for predicting the risk of disease recurrence.']"

Bimetallic catalysts, containing 5 wt.% Ni and 2.5 wt.% Cu, supported on the zeolites, were prepared by a post-synthesis incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Mössbauer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS), and H2–temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analyses. The XRPD results showed that crystalline Cu0 and NixCuy intermetallic nanoparticles were formed in the reduced catalysts. The presence of the intermetallic phase affected the reducibility of the nickel by shifting it to a lower temperature, as confirmed by the H2-TPR curves. Based on the Mössbauer spectroscopic results, it was established that the iron contamination of the coal fly ash zeolites (CFAZs) was distributed in ionic positions of the zeolite lattice and as a finely dispersed iron oxide phase on the external surface of the supports. The formation of the NiFe alloy, not detectable by XRPD, was also evidenced on the impregnated samples. The catalysts were studied in the upgrading of levulinic acid (LA), derived from lignocellulosic biomass, to γ-valerolactone (GVL), in a batch reactor under 30 bar H2 pressure at 150 and 200 °C, applying water as a solvent. The NiCu/SOD and NiCu/X catalysts showed total LA conversion and a high GVL yield (>75%) at a reaction temperature of 200 °C. It was found that the textural parameters of the catalysts have less influence on the catalytic activity, but rather the stable dispersion of metals during the reaction. The characterization of the spent catalyst found the rearrangement of the support structure. The high LA conversion and GVL yield can be attributed to the weak acidic character of the support and the moderate hydrogenation activity of the Ni-Cu sites with high dispersion.', 'Preparing high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with low precious metal loadings for water electrolysis applications (e.g., for green hydrogen production) is challenging and requires electrically conductive, high-surface-area, and stable support materials. Combining the properties of stable TiO2 with those of active iridium oxide, we synthesized highly active electrodes for OER in acidic media. TiO2 powders (both commercially available Degussa P-25® and hydrothermally prepared in the laboratory from TiOSO4, either as received/prepared or following ammonolysis to be converted to titania black), were decorated with IrO2 by UV photodeposition from Ir(III) aqueous solutions of varied methanol scavenger concentrations. TEM, EDS, FESEM, XPS, and XRD measurements demonstrate that the optimized version of the photodeposition preparation method (i.e., with no added methanol) leads to direct deposition of well-dispersed IrO2 nanoparticles. The electroactive surface area and electrocatalytic performance towards OER of these catalysts have been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.1 M HClO4 solutions. All TiO2-based catalysts exhibited better mass-specific (as well as intrinsic) OER activity than commercial unsupported IrO2, with the best of them (IrO2 on Degussa P-25® ΤiO2 and laboratory-made TiO2 black) showing 100 mAmgIr−1 at an overpotential of η = 243 mV. Chronoamperometry (CA) experiments also proved good medium-term stability of the optimum IrO2/TiO2 electrodes during OER.', 'Sol-gel spin coating method was employed for depositing TiO2 and Ag-doped TiO2 films. The effects of Ag doping and the annealing temperatures (300–600 °C) were studied with respect to their structural, morphological, vibrational, and optical properties. Field Emission Scanning Electron microscopy (FESEM) investigation exhibited the grained, compact structures of TiO2-based films. Ag incorporation resulted in a rougher film surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the formation of Ag nanoparticles and AgO phase, along with anatase and rutile TiO2, strongly depending on Ag concentration and technological conditions. AgO fraction diminished after high temperature annealing above 500 °C. The vibrational properties were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It was found that silver presence induced changes in IR bands of TiO2 films. UV–VIS spectroscopy revealed that the embedment of Ag NPs in titania matrix resulted in higher absorbance across the visible spectral range due to local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Ag doping reduced the optical band gap of sol-gel TiO2 films. The optical and plasmonic modifications of TiO2:Ag thin films by the number of layers and different technological conditions (thermal and UV treatment) are discussed.']"

In those cases, emphasis is set on management of cancer-related symptoms, among which obstructive jaundice is most common. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) emerges as a valid alternative to the well-accepted methods for treatment of biliary obstruction. Patient Selection. Five consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic malignancy, were subjected to EUS-BD, particularly EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS). Ethics. Oral and written informed consent was obtained in all cases prior procedure. Technique. EUS-guided puncture of the common bile duct was performed, followed by advancement of a guidewire to the intrahepatic bile ducts. After dilation of the fistulous tract with a cystotome, a fully covered self-expandable metal stent was inserted below the hepatic confluence and extending at least 3 cm in the duodenum. Technical and clinical success was achieved in four patients without adverse events. In one patient procedure failed due to dislocation of the guidewire, with consequent biliary leakage requiring urgent surgery. Recovery was uneventful with no further clinical sequelae and there was no mortality associated with procedure. Discussion. Introduced in 2001, EUS-guided biliary drainage has become an accepted option for treatment of obstructive jaundice. According to recent guidelines published by European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) in 2022, EUS-CDS is a preferred modality to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) and surgery in patients with failed ERCP, with comparable efficiency and better safety profile, which is supported by our experience with the procedure.  Our case series suggests that EUS-CDS is an excellent option for palliative management of malignant distal biliary obstruction, emphasizes on the importance of adequate technique and experience for the technical success, and urges the need for future research on establishing the best choice for guidewire and dilation device.', ""The mini invasive procedure in colorectal surgery is gaining ground as an alternative to conventional surgery. Colorectal surgery has significantly evolved since the advent of the automatic stapler devices and subsequently with the minimally invasive approach. The next logical step - the robotic assisted surgery was developed to satisfy surgeons' needs to the area of colorectal surgery and to offer a new and safer method to patients. The evidence for benefits of its use in this area appears to be promising.  The aim of this study was to analyse and share our initial results in robotic colorectal surgery and compare them with literature data. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted in order to review seven patients with colorectal cancers operated by the robotic-assisted technique over three months in the initial phase of the learning curve. Gender, age, diagnosis, and surgical indication, type of surgery performed, surgical time, conversion, bleeding, post-operative complications, and hospital stay, were analysed and described. A literature review was performed on the role of robotic surgery in colorectal cancer.  Seven patients were operated, 5 males and 2 females with a mean age of 68.2 years. The following procedures were performed: left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis, low anterior resection, left hemicolectomy, sigmoid resection. The mean surgery time for the seven patients was 4 h 06 min, with a time on the console of 2 h and 50 min, and mean bleeding of 192 cc. None of the patients required conversion and the hospital stay was 7 days.  Despite the reduced case series, the initial results of our learning curve in colorectal robotic surgery are among the parameters imposed by the medical literature."", 'Colorectal cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Approximately, one of three diagnosed colorectal cancers is a rectal cancer. Recent developments in the field of rectal surgery have promoted the use of surgical robots, which are of great need when surgeons face anatomical difficulties, such as a narrowed male pelvis, bulky tumor, or obese patients. This study aims to evaluate the clinical results of robotic rectal cancer surgery during the introduction period of a surgical robot system. Moreover, the period of the introduction of this technique coincided with the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Since December 2019, the Surgery Department of the University Hospital of Varna has become the newest and the most modern Robotic Surgery Center of Competence in Bulgaria, equipped with the most advanced da Vinci Xi surgical system. From January 2020 to October 2020 a total number of 43 patients have underwent surgical treatment, of which 21 had roboticassisted procedures and the rest - open procedures.  Patient characteristics were close between the studied groups. The mean patient age in robotic surgery was 65 years, as six of these patients were females, while in case of open surgery these values were to 70 and 6, respectively. Two thirds (66.7%) of the patients operated on with da Vinci Xi were with tumor stage 3 or 4 and approximately 10% had the tumor located in the lower part of the rectum. The median value of the operation time was 210 min, while the length of hospital stay was 7 days. These short-term parameters were not found to have a large difference in respect to the open surgery group. A significant difference is depicted for the number of lymph nodes resected and the blood loss, with both parameters demonstrating advantage for the robot-assisted surgery. The blood loss is more than twice less than the case of open surgery.  The results confidently showed the successful introduction of the robot-assisted platform in the surgery department despite the limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This technique is expected to become the main choice of minimally invasive technique applied to all types of colorectal cancer surgery in the Robotic Surgery Center of Competence.']"

Most patients with T1DM should follow a regimen of multiple daily injections of basal/bolus insulin, but those not meeting individual glycemic targets or those with frequent or severe hypoglycemia or pronounced dawn phenomenon should consider continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. The latter treatment modality could also be an alternative based on patient preferences and availability of reimbursement. Continuous glucose monitoring may improve glycemic control irrespective of treatment regimen. A glycemic target of glycated hemoglobin < 7% (53\xa0mmol/mol) is appropriate for most nonpregnant adults. Basal insulin analogues with a reduced peak profile and an extended duration of action with lower intraindividual variability relative to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin are preferred. The clinical advantages of basal analogues compared with older basal insulins include reduced injection burden, better efficacy, lower risk of hypoglycemic episodes (especially nocturnal), and reduced weight gain. For prandial glycemic control, any rapid-acting prandial analogue (aspart, glulisine, lispro) is preferred over regular human insulin. Faster-acting insulin aspart is a relatively new option with the advantage of better postprandial glucose coverage. Frequent blood glucose measurements along with patient education on insulin dosing based on carbohydrate counting, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated physical activity is paramount, as is education on the management of blood glucose under different circumstances. Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary is available for this article.', 'In order to influence every day clinical practice professional organisations issue management guidelines. Cross-sectional surveys are used to evaluate the implementation of such guidelines. The present survey investigated screening for glucose perturbations in people with coronary artery disease and compared patients with known and newly detected type 2 diabetes with those without diabetes in terms of their life-style and pharmacological risk factor management in relation to contemporary European guidelines.  A total of 6187 patients (18-80years) with coronary artery disease and known glycaemic status based on a self reported history of diabetes (previously known diabetes) or the results of an oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c (no diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes) were investigated in EUROASPIRE IV including patients in 24 European countries 2012-2013. The patients were interviewed and investigated in order to enable a comparison between their actual risk factor control with that recommended in current European management guidelines and the outcome in previously conducted surveys.  A total of 2846 (46%) patients had no diabetes, 1158 (19%) newly diagnosed diabetes and 2183 (35%) previously known diabetes. The combined use of all four cardioprotective drugs in these groups was 53, 55 and 60%, respectively. A blood pressure target of <140/90mmHg was achieved in 68, 61, 54% and a LDL-cholesterol target of <1.8mmol/L in 16, 18 and 28%. Patients with newly diagnosed and previously known diabetes reached an HbA1c <7.0% (53mmol/mol) in 95 and 53% and 11% of those with previously known diabetes had an HbA1c >9.0% (>75mmol/mol). Of the patients with diabetes 69% reported on low physical activity. The proportion of patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation programmes was low (≈40%) and only 27% of those with diabetes had attended diabetes schools. Compared with data from previous surveys the use of cardioprotective drugs had increased and more patients were achieving the risk factor treatment targets.  Despite advances in patient management there is further potential to improve both the detection and management of patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease.', 'The aim of this study is to demonstrate the real-life effectiveness and safety of insulin glargine 300\xa0U/mL (Gla-300) in patients with type\xa02 diabetes (T2D) previously uncontrolled on NPH ± prandial insulin or premixed insulins in routine clinical practice in Bulgaria.

Families provided baseline data on energy balance-related behaviors and socioeconomic factors via questionnaires. Children’s dietary intake and breakfast consumption were assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires, and anthropometric measurements were taken. Intake from 11 food groups was analyzed by country, gender, and obesity degree. Chi-square analyses compared food intake with dietary guidelines. “Nutrient-dense "" foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables, whole grains) and ""energy-dense, low-nutrient"" foods (e.g., high in added sugars, saturated fats) were categorized based on the European food-based guideline. Over 85% of children consumed breakfast 5–7\xa0days a week, with no significant differences by Body Mass Index (BMI) or country.

A partial mediation effect of the parental diet quality was shown on the association between the frequency of family meals and the consumption of some selected food items (i.e., milk products and salty snacks) among boys and girls. The strongest mediation effect of parental diet quality was found on the association between the frequency of family breakfast and the consumption of salty snacks and milk and milk products (62.5% and 37.5%, respectively) among girls.  The frequency of family meals is positively associated with improved food consumption patterns (i.e., higher intake of fruits and vegetables and reduced consumption of sweets) in both parents and children.

Their presence is associated with renal involvement, in particular with lupus nephritis (LN) and the titre of these autoantibodies correlates with the clinical activity of the disease. We analysed by ELISA 18 SLE sera with biopsy-proved LN for the presence of autoantibodies against the globular fragment of C1q using recombinant globular head regions of A, B and C chains of human C1q (ghA, ghB and ghC, respectively). For reference we analysed the sera from 62 healthy volunteers. The recombinant proteins were used as test-antigens to evaluate the levels of autoantibodies specific for ghA, ghB and ghC. LN sera, containing high levels of anti-C1q antibodies, showed differential increased binding to ghA, ghB and ghC.', 'Autoantibodies against the complement component C1q (anti-C1q) are among the main biomarkers in lupus nephritis (LN) known to contribute to renal injury. C1q, the recognition subcomponent of the complement classical pathway, forms a heterotetrameric complex with C1r and C1s, and can also associate a central complement regulator and C1 Inhibitor (C1-Inh). However, the frequency and the pathogenic relevance of anti-C1r, anti-C1s and anti-C1-Inh autoantibodies remain poorly studied in LN. In this paper, we screened for anti-C1q, anti-C1r, anti-C1s and anti-C1-Inh autoantibodies and evaluated their association with disease activity and severity in 74 LN patients followed up for 5 years with a total of 266 plasma samples collected. The presence of anti-C1q, anti-C1r, anti-C1s and anti-C1-Inh was assessed by ELISA. IgG was purified by Protein G from antigen-positive plasma and their binding to purified C1q, C1r and C1s was examined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The abilities of anti-C1q, anti-C1r and anti-C1s binding IgG on C1 complex formation were analyzed by ELISA. The screening of LN patients’ plasma revealed 14.9% anti-C1q positivity; only 4.2%, 6.9% and 0% were found to be positive for anti-C1r, anti-C1s and anti-C1-Inh, respectively. Significant correlations were found between anti-C1q and anti-dsDNA, and anti-nuclear antibodies, C3 and C4, respectively. High levels of anti-C1q antibodies were significantly associated with renal histologic lesions and correlated with histological activity index. Patients with the most severe disease (A class according to BILAG Renal score) had higher levels of anti-C1q antibodies. Anti-C1r and anti-C1s antibodies did not correlate with the clinical characteristics of the LN patients, did not interfere with the C1 complex formation, and were not measurable via SPR. In conclusion, the presence of anti-C1q, but not anti-C1s or anti-C1r, autoantibodies contribute to the autoimmune pathology and the severity of LN.', 'Lupus nephritis (LN) is a complication of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Because the complement system plays a critical role in orchestrating inflammatory and immune responses as well as in the clearance of immune complexes, autoreactivity to complement components may have considerable pathological consequences. Autoantibodies against the central complement component C3 have been reported in systemic lupus erythematosus, but their molecular mechanism and functional relevance are not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the functional properties of the anti-C3 autoantibodies. Anti-C3 autoantibodies were measured in plasma of 39 LN patients, and identification of their epitopes on the C3 molecule was performed. By using surface plasmon resonance, we analyzed the influence of patient-derived IgG antibodies on the interaction of C3b with Factor B, Factor H, and complement receptor 1. The capacity of these antibodies to dysregulate the C3 convertase on the surface of endothelial cell was measured by flow cytometry. Here we report that the frequency of anti-C3 autoantibodies in LN is ∼30%. They inhibited interactions of the negative complement regulators Factor H and complement receptor 1 with C3b. An enhanced C3 deposition was also observed on human endothelial cells in the presence of C3 autoantibodies. In addition, anti-C3 autoantibody levels correlated with disease activity. In conclusion, the anti-C3 autoantibodies in LN may contribute to the autoimmune pathology by their capacity to overactivate the complement system.']"

Materials and  The research was conducted at a secondary school in the Siberian Federal District. We observed 24 girls aged 16-18 (17.2±0.8 years), who were divided into 12 people into the control (CG) and experimental groups (EG). They attended the school general physical training section three times a week during free time. Each training session lasted 90 minutes. Training in both groups was conducted according to the traditional program for developing general physical qualities. The EG girls used our improved method of developing speed-strength qualities using the CrossFit training system, which took up 30-40% of the total time of each lesson and was included in the main part of the educational and training sessions on general physical training for three months (from February to April). Each set of CrossFit exercises had elements of a speed-strength focus. The performance of loads in aerobic and anaerobic modes was combined. At the beginning and end of the research project, the state of speed-strength qualities of girls in both observed groups was assessed using motor tests.  The results of testing motor qualities established a higher efficiency of the improved method of improving speed-strength qualities in EG girls, where the CrossFit training system was used compared to CG.

Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in microglia results in a dysfunctional and pro-inflammatory state in the aged brain and worsens the outcome of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of LD-rich microglia (LDRM) under stroke conditions is unknown. Using in vitro and in vivo stroke models, herein accumulation patterns of microglial LD and their corresponding microglial inflammatory signaling cascades are studied. Interactions between temporal and spatial dynamics of lipid profiles and microglial phenotypes in different post-stroke brain regions are found. Hence, microglia display enhanced levels of LD accumulation and elevated perilipin 2 (PLIN2) expression patterns when exposed to hypoxia or stroke. Such LDRM exhibit high levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β as well as a pro-inflammatory phenotype and differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related genes. These post-ischemic alterations result in distinct lipid profiles with spatial and temporal dynamics, especially with regard to cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol levels, further exacerbating post-ischemic inflammation. The present study sheds new light on the dynamic changes of brain lipid profiles and aggregation patterns of LD in microglia exposed to ischemia, demonstrating a mutual mechanism between microglial phenotype and function, which contributes to progression of brain injury.', 'Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane receptor protein predominantly expressed in microglia within the central nervous system (CNS). TREM2 regulates multiple microglial functions, including lipid metabolism, immune reaction, inflammation, and microglial phagocytosis. Recent studies have found that TREM2 is highly expressed in activated microglia after ischemic stroke. However, the role of TREM2 in the pathologic response after stroke remains unclear. Herein, TREM2-deficient microglia exhibit an impaired phagocytosis rate and cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation, leading to lipid droplet formation and upregulation of Perilipin-2 (PLIN2) expression after hypoxia. Knockdown of TREM2 results in increased lipid synthesis (PLIN2, SOAT1) and decreased cholesterol clearance and lipid hydrolysis (LIPA, ApoE, ABCA1, NECH1, and NPC2), further impacting microglial phenotypes. In these lipid droplet-rich microglia, the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway is downregulated, driving microglia towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Meanwhile, in a neuron-microglia co-culture system under hypoxic conditions, we found that microglia lost their protective effect against neuronal injury and apoptosis when TREM2 was knocked down. Under in vivo conditions, TREM2 knockdown mice express lower TGF-β1 expression levels and a lower number of anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype microglia, resulting in increased cerebral infarct size, exacerbated neuronal apoptosis, and aggravated neuronal impairment. Our work suggests that TREM2 attenuates stroke-induced neuroinflammation by modulating the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. TREM2 may play a direct role in the regulation of inflammation and also exert an influence on the post-ischemic inflammation and the stroke pathology progression via regulation of lipid metabolism processes. Thus, underscoring the therapeutic potential of TREM2 agonists in ischemic stroke and making TREM2 an attractive new clinical target for the treatment of ischemic stroke and other inflammation-related diseases.', 'Stem cell-based therapies and extracellular vesicle (EV) treatment have demonstrated significant potential for neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. Although the neuroprotective mechanisms are not yet fully understood, targeting microglia is central to promoting neuroprotection. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. These cells are crucial in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. They respond rapidly to the site of injury by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, phagocytizing dead cells and debris, and recruiting peripheral immune cells to the ischemic area. Although these responses are essential for clearing damage and initiating tissue repair, excessive or prolonged microglial activation can exacerbate brain injury, leading to secondary neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, microglia exhibit a dynamic range of activation states with the so-called M1 pro-inflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory phenotypes, representing the two ends of the spectrum. The delivery of both EVs and stem cells modulates microglial activation, suppressing pro-inflammatory genes, influencing the expression of transcription factors, and altering receptor expression, ultimately contributing to neuroprotection. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the complex and dynamic role of microglia in the development of effective neuroprotective strategies to reduce the effects of ischemic stroke. In this review, we examine the current state of knowledge regarding the role of microglia in ischemic stroke, including their molecular and cellular mechanisms, activation states, and interactions with other cells. We also discuss the multifaceted contributions of microglia to stem cell- and EV-based neuroprotection during an ischemic stroke to provide a comprehensive understanding of microglial functions and their potential implications in stroke therapies.']"

Melatonin deficiency induced at different life stages did not affect the lifespan of rats. Pinealectomy abolished the circadian rhythm of motor activity, measured for 48\xa0h in the actimeter, in young adult but not in middle-aged rats. Pinealectomy reduced the motor activity of the young adult rats during the dark phase and impaired the diurnal activity variations of old rats. The same generations (3- and 18\xa0month-old rats with pinealectomy) had lower anxiety levels than the matched sham groups, measured in three tests: elevated-plus maze, light–dark test, and novelty-suppressed feeding test. While the activity of the HPA axis remained intact in young adult and middle-aged rats with melatonin deficiency, a high baseline corticosterone level and blunted stress-induced mechanism of its release were detected in the oldest rats. Age-associated reduced Hsp 70 and 90 levels in the FC but not in the hippocampus were detected. Pinealectomy diminished the expression of Hsp 70 in the FC of middle-aged rats compared to the matched sham rats.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with the melatonin analogue Piromelatine on the associative and spatial hippocampus-dependent memory of male and female offspring with a history of prenatal stress (PNS). We report that male and female young adult offspring with PNS treated with a vehicle had reduced memory responses in an object recognition test (ORT). However, the cognitive performance in the radial arm maze test (RAM) was worsened only in the male offspring. The 32-day treatment with Piromelatine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) of male and female offspring with PNS attenuated the impaired responses in the ORT task. Furthermore, the melatonin analogue corrected the disturbed spatial memory in the male offspring. While the ratio of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (pCREB/CREB) was reduced in the two sexes with PNS and treated with a vehicle, the melatonin analogue elevated the ratio of these signaling molecules in the hippocampus of the male rats only. Our results suggest that Piromelatine exerts a beneficial effect on PNS-induced spatial memory impairment in a sex-dependent manner that might be mediated via the pCREB/CREB pathway.', 'Cholinesterase inhibitors are currently used in the therapy of different kind of dementia to improve brain memory functions. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate was studied in naive rats and in rats with a model of sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia. One active avoidance test and in two passive avoidance tests were used. In the active avoidance test metrifonate increased the number of avoidances during the learning session only. In both passive avoidance tests, metrifonate prolonged latency differently during the learning session and in short-term or in long-term memory retention. Hypoxic rats showed lower numbers of avoidances in learning and memory retention sessions. Metrifonate increased the number of avoidances during the learning session for hypoxic rats. In the step-through passive avoidance test, metrifonate increased the latency of reactions in the learning session and in long-term memory retention tests. In the step-down passive avoidance test, the groups with hypoxia and metrifonate did not change the latency of reaction in the learning and long-term memory retention sessions, but increased the latency of reactions in the short-term memory retention test. Morphological data showed a significant impaired neuronal structure in a CA1 zone of the hippocampus in hypoxic rats and a tendency to preserving in rats treated with metrifonate. Our results suggest that metrifonate improves cognitive functions in naive and in hypoxic rats.']"

Materials and  A 3-year multicentre randomized trial in eight countries using a 2 x 2 diet-by-PA factorial design was conducted. Eight-week weight reduction was followed by a 3-year randomized weight-maintenance phase. In total, 2326 adults (age 25-70 years, body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2) with prediabetes were enrolled. The primary endpoint was 3-year incidence of T2D analysed by diet treatment. Secondary outcomes included glucose, insulin, HbA1c and body weight.  The total number of T2D cases was 62 and the cumulative incidence rate was 3.1%, with no significant differences between the two diets, PA or their combination.

We enrolled overweight adults from eight European countries who had lost at least 8% of their initial body weight with a 3.3-MJ (800-kcal) low-calorie diet. Participants were randomly assigned, in a two-by-two factorial design, to one of five ad libitum diets to prevent weight regain over a 26-week period: a low-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a low-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, or a control diet.

Blood samples were collected at baseline, after 8 weeks of low-energy diet-induced weight loss and after a 6-month dietary intervention period from female continued weight losers (n 48) and weight regainers (n 48), evenly selected from four dietary groups that varied in protein and GI levels. The blood concentrations of twenty-nine proteins and three steroid hormones were measured. The changes in analytes during weight maintenance largely correlated negatively with the changes during weight loss, with some differences between continued weight losers and weight regainers. Increases in leptin (LEP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly associated with weight regain (P < 0•001 and P = 0•005, respectively), and these relationships were influenced by the diet. Consuming a high-protein and high-GI diet dissociated the positive relationship between the change in LEP concentration and weight regain. CRP increased during the weight-maintenance period only in weight regainers with a high-protein diet (P < 0•001). In addition, testosterone, luteinising hormone, angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, resistin, retinol-binding protein 4, insulin, glucagon, haptoglobin and growth hormone were also affected by the dietary intervention.

The total antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the capacity of the sample to inhibit the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS).  The results show that the extract has the lowest toxicity on the MDBK cell line and similar cytotoxicity in Hep-2, whereas in the MDCK cells it has more than twice the highest toxicity. Testing the antiviral activity of Tanacetum vulgare L. extract revealed a slight inhibition of replication of HSV-1 with a selective index of 7.07 and IAV/H3N2 (SI = 3.69) but no specific antiviral effect against CVB1 replication was found. The evaluation of the antioxidant activity showed great antioxidant activity of the ethanolic extract from T. vulgare - 26 mmol/l for the applied 20 mg/ml extract.  The crude extract from aerial parts of the medicinal plant Tanacetum vulgare L. demonstrated low cytotoxicity in Hep-2, MDBK and moderate cytotoxic effects in MDCK cells. It exerted significant antiviral activity against HSV-1 as determined by the re - corded inhibition of viral replication, the blockage of virus entry - absorption stage and direct virucidal effects on extracellular virions. The observed effect when testing Tanacetum's extract on influenza A H3N2 virus infection in vitro was milder, which probably resulted from the interference with the cellular pathways involved in the replication cycle. The presence of virucidal and adsorption-suppressing activity but the absence of viral replication inhibitory effects against CBV-1 suggests a possible interaction of the extract's components with viral capsid proteins or related cell receptors.""]"

The potential benefit of initial dose intensification of imatinib in pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia remains unknown. Design and Two hundred and twenty-seven pre-treated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were randomly assigned to continuous treatment with a standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/day; n=113) or to 6 months of high-dose induction with imatinib (800 mg/day) followed by a standard dose of imatinib as maintenance therapy (n=114). The rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses were significantly higher in the highdose arm than in the standard-dose arm at both 3 and 6 months (major cytogenetic responses: 36.8% versus 21.2%, P=0.01 and 50.0% versus 34.5%, P=0.018; complete cytogenetic responses: 22.8% versus 6.2%, P<0.001 and 40.4% versus 16.8%, P<0.001) on the basis of an intentionto-treat analysis. At 12 months, the difference between treatment arms remained statistically significant for complete cytogenetic responses (40.4% versus 24.8%, P=0.012) but not for major cytogenetic responses (49.1% versus 44.2%, P=0.462). The rate of major molecular responses was also significantly better at 3 and 6 months in the high-dose arm (month 3: 14.9% versus 3.5%, P=0.003; month 6: 32.5% versus 8.8%, P<0.001). Overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between arms, but event-free survival was significantly worse in the high-dose arm (P=0.014). Standard-dose imatinib remains the standard of care for pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00327262).', 'Summary: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a pluripotent hemopoietic stem cell malignancy characterized by the presence of a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene derived from a balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22) (q34; q11)] known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. CML is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell disease common to myelo- and lymphopoiesis, characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of granulopoiesis (Shuvaev et al. 2015; Yordanov and Varbanova 2019). Relevance and goals: Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib) have an advantage over imatinib (first-generation) in the frequency and speed of achieving cytogenetic and molecular responses in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but they cause severe adverse effects and are much more expensive than imatinib, especially if we compare them to the prices of the registered generic products of Imatinib and Dasatinib. “Novartis Tasigna® trial shows superior results to Glivec® in patients with early-stage chronic myeloid leukemia”, reported on 10/20/2021 by Pierre Perrin-Montlouis. In the first direct comparison of these two oral therapies back in 2009 (Тasigna (nilotinib) 2009), as first-line treatment for CML, the results of Tasigna showed statistically significant improvement over Glivec in every measure of efficacy, including major molecular response (MMR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and prevention of progression to accelerated or blast phase, with responses achieved faster in the Tasigna group than in the Glivec group. Furthermore, in the last ten years, CML patients who have achieved a stable deep molecular response for at least 2 years have been included in clinical trials for the management of treatment-free remission (TFR) (Kim et al. 2013; Saußele et al. 2016). On the other hand, the ever-increasing costs of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of the response of CML to the various therapeutic strategies require conducting pharmacoeconomic analyses of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility types in order to evaluate which are the cost-effective strategies with a view to introducing them into therapeutic practice. The present study aims to analyze the pharmacoeconomic efficiency of the TKI inhibitors used by the patients with CML-CP in the first and second lines, treated in the hematology clinic at UMHAT “St. George”, MU- Plovdiv during the period 2018–2022.  An economic analysis of the medicinal use of TKIs for a 5-year period (2018–2022) was performed at the national level according to data from the National Health Insurance Fund and the availability, accessibility, and usability of original and generic TKIs in Bulgaria were evaluated. The direct medical costs for the therapy of all patients were calculated, including the costs of the TKI therapy, laboratory tests, and monitoring of the molecular response for the entire treatment period from the appointment of the TKI therapy until the end of 2022. A comparative analysis was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of the different therapeutic strategies with TKIs on the first and second lines of treatment of patients with CML-CP in the hematology clinic at UMHAT “St. George” Medical University, Plovdiv, using the decision analysis method and conducting one-way and probalistic sensitivity analyses.  The sensitivity analyzes of all pharmacoeconomic models showed the robustness and reliability of the obtained results. The threshold limits of medical costs and the frequency of achieving a deep molecular response determining the choice of first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors as first- and second-line therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase have been determined. Prescribing doctors prefer the original MPs to generic analogues, which is also assumed by the current regulations, according to which even for expensive MPs dispensing by protocols, the prescription is by trade and not by international non-proprietary names (INN), which is why the use of the much cheaper generic MPs is negligibly low compared to original MPs. A personalized approach to the patient’s therapy and monitoring the patient’s molecular response to it, as well as stopping therapy in 25–30% of patients suitable to stop it safely when in TFR phase with a probability of more than 50% of not having a relapse will save additional costs that, by improving the cost-effectiveness of therapy for patients with CML, will be directed towards the treatment of new patients with this or other diseases.  These pharmacoeconomic models can be applied to improve diagnostic and therapeutic standards in clinical practice and for the efficient use of the very limited resources for health care in countries like Bulgaria. The conducted cost-effectiveness analyses confirmed that the hematologists at the University Center in Plovdiv adhere to the recommendations of Leukemia Net and the Bulgarian Medical Society of Hematology and achieve not only good therapeutic but also pharmacoeconomic efficiency in the treatment of CML-СР patients in first- and second- line therapy.', 'To compare the main features of patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) after post-myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-post-MDS) or post-myeloproliferative neoplasms (AML-post-MPN) and myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-BC) vs. de novo AMLs with myelodysplastic characteristics (dn-AML-MDS). Materials and methods: Bone marrow/peripheral blood samples of 94 patients with secondary AMLs (30 with AML-post-MDS, 20 with AML-post-MPN, and 14 with CML-BC) and 30 with dn-AML-MDS were included. Demographic, morphological, phenotypic, cytogenetic, and survival data were analyzed.  Comparative analysis showed no differences in sex and age, except for the younger age in CML-BC (p=0.005). Leukocytosis was a prevalent feature of CML-BC vs. AML-post-MPN, AML-post-MDS and dn-AML-MDS (p<0.001). At leukemia onset, thrombocytopenia was characteristic of AML-post-MDS and dn-AML-MDS whereas normal PLT counts were found in AML-post-MPN and CML-BC (p=0.001). Dysplasia in ≥2 lineages was observed in almost all dn-AML-MDS (96.8%) and AML-post-MDS (100%) compared to AML-post-MPN (33.3%) and none of the CML-BC (p=0.001). Aberrant co-expression of 1-4 lymphoid-associated markers was detected in 67.5% of all patients, including CD7, CD19, CD56, and CD22. We found chromosome aberrations in 57.8% of patients, more frequently in dn-AML-post-MDS than in AML-post-MPN, CML-BC, and AML-post-MDS. While NPM1 mutations distribution was similar in the two MDS-related AML groups, FLT3-ITD was higher in AML-post-MDS (26.3%) than in dn-AML-MDS (4.5%) (p=0.049). Regarding EVI1, CML-BC (80%) and AML-post-MPN (37.5%) showed higher incidence of gene overexpression compared to AML-post-MDS (13.3%) and dn-AML-MDS (5.0%) (p=0.001). Median time to leukemia was significantly shorter in AML-post-MDS (4.80±1.04 months) than in AML-post-MPN (20.3±2.86 months) and CML-BC (34.7±16.3 months) (p=0.008), and median overall survival was poor in all groups.  Similarities and differences between patients with secondary AMLs may represent different biology which translates into different clinical course and may require different therapeutic approach in future.']"

The majority arise sporadically, but an inherited genetic susceptibility is increasingly being recognized. Recent advances in genetics have widened the scope of our understanding of pituitary tumorigenesis. The clinical and genetic characteristics of pituitary adenomas that develop in the setting of germline-mosaic and somatic GNAS mutations (McCune-Albright syndrome and sporadic acromegaly), germline MEN1 mutations (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1), and germline PRKAR1A mutations (Carney complex) have been well described. Non-syndromic familial cases of isolated pituitary tumors can occur as familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA); mutations/deletions of the AIP gene have been found in a minority of these. Genetic alterations in GPR101 have been identified recently as causing X-linked acro-gigantism (X-LAG) leading to very early-onset pediatric gigantism. Associations of pituitary adenomas with other tumors have been described in syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4, pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma with pituitary adenoma association (3PAs) syndrome and some of their genetic causes have been elucidated. The genetic etiologies of a significant proportions of sporadic corticotropinomas have recently been identified with the discovery of USP8 and USP48 mutations. The elucidation of genetic and molecular pathophysiology in pituitary adenomas is a key factor for better patient management and effective follow-up.', 'Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) is one of the most f requent conditions associated with an inherited presentation of pituitary tumors. FIPA can present with pituitary adenomas of any secretory/non-secretory type. Mutations in the gene for the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) have been identified in approximately 20% of FIPA families and are the most frequent cause (29%) of p ituitary gigantism. Pituitary tumors in FIPA are larger, occur at a younger age and display more aggressive characteristics and evolution than sporadic adenomas. This aggressiveness is especially marked in FIPA kindreds with AIP mutations. Special attention should be paid to young patients with pituitary gigantism and/or macroadenomas, as AIP mutations are prevalent in these groups. Duplications on chromosome Xq26.3 involving the gene GPR101 lead to X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG), a syndrome of pituitary gigantism beginning in early childhood; three kindreds with X-LAG have presented in the setting of FIPA. Management of pituitary adenomas in the setting of FIPA, AIP mutations and GPR101 duplications is often more complex than in sporadic disease due to early onset disease, aggressive tumor growth and resistance to medical therapy.', 'AIP mutations (AIPmut) give rise to a pituitary adenoma predisposition that occurs in familial isolated pituitary adenomas and less often in sporadic cases. The clinical and therapeutic features of AIPmut-associated pituitary adenomas have not been studied comprehensively.  The objective of the study was to assess clinical/therapeutic characteristics of AIPmut pituitary adenomas. Design: This study was an international, multicenter, retrospective case collection/database analysis. Setting: The study was conducted at 36 tertiary referral endocrine and clinical genetics departments. Patients: Patients included 96 patients with germline AIPmut and pituitary adenomas and 232 matched AIPmut-negative acromegaly controls.  The AIPmut population was predominantly young and male (63.5%); first symptoms occurred as children/adolescents in 50%. At diagnosis, most tumors were macroadenomas (93.3%); extension and invasion was common. Somatotropinomas comprised 78.1% of the cohort; there were also prolactinomas (n = 13), nonsecreting adenomas (n = 7), and a TSH-secreting adenoma. AIPmut somatotropinomas were larger (P = 0.00026), with higher GH levels (P = 0.00068), more frequent extension (P = 0.018) and prolactin cosecretion (P = 0.00023), and occurred 2 decades before controls (P < 0.000001). Gigantism was more common in the AIPmut group (P < 0.000001). AIPmut somatotropinoma patients underwent more surgical interventions (P = 0.00069) and had lower decreases in GH (P = 0.00037) and IGF-I (P = 0.028) and less tumor shrinkage with somatostatin analogs (P < 0.00001) vs. controls. AIPmut prolactinomas occurred generally in young males and frequently required surgery or radiotherapy.  AIPmut pituitary adenomas have clinical features that may negatively impact treatment efficacy. Predisposition for aggressive disease in young patients, often in a familial setting, suggests that earlier diagnosis of AIPmut pituitary adenomas may have clinical utility.']"

Previous studies have indicated that subtype B is the most common strain in Bulgaria, particularly among men who have sex with men, who are at a high risk of transmission. The primary objective of this study was to identify any transmission clusters and transmission resistance in individuals newly diagnosed with HIV-1 who have not yet received antiretroviral therapy (ART). To this end, we sequenced the HIV-1 pol gene in the samples from the study participants using either the Viroseq HIV-1 Genotyping Test (Abbott) and the Applied Biosystems 3130xl genetic analyzer or the TruGene DNA Sequencing System (Siemens Healthcare) and an OpenGene D NA sequencing system. We then subtyped the HIV-1 pol sequences, and further analyzed those that met the criteria for subtype B. The study included a total of 595 HIV-1 subtype B sequences. Our analysis revealed that the majority of those diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B were male and lived in Sofia region. The most common transmission mode was through sexual intercourse among men who have sex with men, followed by heterosexual transmission. We also observed the presence of multiple transmission clusters, and a low percentage of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs). Overall, our study confirms that HIV-1 subtype B remains the most dominant strain in Bulgaria.', ""Knowledge of HIV status can be important in reducing the risk of HIV exposure. In a European sample of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), we aimed to identify factors associated with HIV serostatus disclosure to the most recent anal intercourse (AI) partner. We also aimed to describe the impact of HIV serostatus disclosure on HIV exposure risks.  During 2013 and 2014, 4901 participants were recruited for the bio-behavioural Sialon-II study in 13 European cities. Behavioural data were collected with a self-administered paper questionnaire. Biological specimens were tested for HIV antibodies. Factors associated with HIV serostatus disclosure with the most recent AI partner were examined using bivariate and multilevel multivariate logistic regression analysis. We also describe the role of serostatus disclosure for HIV exposure of the most recent AI partner.  Thirty-five percent (n = 1450) of the study participants reported mutual serostatus disclosure with their most recent AI partner or disclosed having HIV to their partner. Most of these disclosures occurred between steady partners (74%, n = 1077). In addition to the type of partner and HIV diagnosis status, other factors positively associated with HIV serostatus disclosure in the multilevel multivariate logistic regression model were recent testing, no condom use, and outness regarding sexual orientation. Disclosure rates were lowest in three south-eastern European cities. Following condom use (51%, n = 2099), HIV serostatus disclosure (20%, n = 807) was the second most common prevention approach with the most recent AI partner, usually resulting in serosorting. A potential HIV exposure risk for the partner was reported by 26% (111/432) of HIV antibody positive study participants. In 18% (20/111) of exposure episodes, an incorrect HIV serostatus was unknowingly communicated. Partner exposures were equally distributed between steady and non-steady partners.  The probability of HIV exposure through condomless AI is substantially lower after serostatus disclosure compared to non-disclosure. Incorrect knowledge of one's HIV status contributes to a large proportion of HIV exposures amongst European MSM. Maintaining or improving condom use for anal intercourse with non-steady partners, frequent testing to update HIV serostatus awareness, and increased serostatus disclosure particularly between steady partners are confirmed as key aspects for reducing HIV exposures amongst European MSM."", 'Reducing the number of people with undiagnosed HIV infection is a major goal of HIV control and prevention efforts in Europe and elsewhere. We analysed data from a large multi-city European bio-behavioural survey conducted among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) for previously undiagnosed HIV infections, and aimed to characterise undiagnosed MSM who test less frequently than recommended.  Data on sexual behaviours and social characteristics of MSM with undiagnosed HIV infection from Sialon II, a bio-behavioural cross-sectional survey conducted in 13 European cities in 2013/2014, were compared with HIV-negative MSM. Based on reported HIV-testing patterns, we distinguished two subgroups: MSM with a negative HIV test result within 12 months prior to the study, i.e. undiagnosed incident infection, and HIV positive MSM with unknown onset of infection. Bivariate and multivariate associations of explanatory variables were analysed. Distinct multivariate multi-level random-intercept models were estimated for the entire group and both subgroups.  Among 497 participants with HIV-reactive specimens, 234 (47.1%) were classified as previously diagnosed, 106 (21.3%) as incident, and 58 (11.7%) as unknown onset based on self-reported status and testing history. MSM with incident HIV infection were twice as likely (odds ratio (OR) = 2.22, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.17-4.21) to have used recreational substances during their last anal sex encounter and four times more likely (OR = 3.94, 95%CI: 2.14-7.27) not to discuss their HIV status with the last anal sex partner(s). MSM with unknown onset of HIV infection were 3.6 times more likely (OR = 3.61, 95%CI: 1.74-7.50) to report testing for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) during the last 12 months.  Approximately one third of the study participants who are living with HIV were unaware of their infection. Almost two-third (65%) of those with undiagnosed HIV appeared to have acquired the infection recently, emphasizing a need for more frequent testing. Men with the identified behavioural characteristics could be considered as primary target group for HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to avoid HIV infection. The increased odds of those with unknown onset of HIV infection to have had an STI test in the past year strongly suggests a lost opportunity to offer HIV testing.']"

To investigate factors influencing results of IFN-γ release assays in children using a large European data set.  The Pediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials group pooled and analyzed data from five sites across Europe comprising 1,128 children who were all investigated for latent tuberculosis infection by tuberculin skin test and at least one IFN-γ release assay. Multivariate analyses examined age, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination status, and sex as predictor variables of results. Subgroup analyses included children who were household contacts. Measurements and Main  A total of 1,093 children had a QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay and 382 had a T-SPOT.TB IFN-γ release assay. Age was positively correlated with a positive blood result (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube: odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per year increasing age [P < 0.0001]; T-SPOT.TB: OR, 1.14 per year increasing age [P < 0.001]). A positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube result was shown by 5.5% of children with a tuberculin skin test result less than 5mm, by 14.8% if less than 10 mm, and by 20.2% if less than 15 mm. Prior BCG vaccination was associated with a negative IFN-γ release assay result (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube: OR, 0.41 [P < 0.001]; T-SPOT.TB: OR, 0.41 [P < 0.001]). Young age was a predictor of indeterminate IFN-γ release assay results, but indeterminate rates were low (3.6% in children < 5 yr, 1% in children > 5 yr).  Our data show that BCG vaccination may be effective in protecting children against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. To restrict use of IFN-γ release assays to children with positive skin tests risks underestimating latent infection.', 'Rationale In 2016, a new interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) was introduced, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), claimed to have improved sensitivity in active tuberculosis (TB). This study aimed to determine the performance of QFT-Plus, compared with previous generation IGRAs and the tuberculin skin test (TST), in children with TB in Europe. Multicentre, ambispective cohort study within the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet), a dedicated paediatric TB research network comprising >300 members, capturing TB cases <18 years-of-age diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2019. Measurements and main results 1001 TB cases from 16 countries were included (mean age (IQR) 5.6 (2.4-12.1) years). QFT-Plus was performed in 358, QFT Gold in-Tube (QFT-GIT) in 600, T-SPOT.TB in 58 and TST in 636 cases. The overall test sensitivities were: QFT-Plus 83.8% (95% CI 80.2% to 87.8%), QFT-GIT 85.5% (95% CI 82.7% to 88.3%), T-SPOT.TB 77.6% (95% CI 66.9% to 88.3%) and TST (cut-off ≥10 mm) 83.3% (95% CI 83.3% to 86.2%). There was a trend for tests to have lower sensitivity in patients with miliary and/or central nervous system (CNS) TB (73.1%, 70.9%, 63.6% and 43.5%, respectively), and in immunocompromised patients (75.0%, 59.6%, 45.5% and 59.1%, respectively). The results indicate that the latest generation IGRA assay, QFT-Plus, does not perform better than previous generation IGRAs or the TST in children with TB disease. Overall, tests performed worse in CNS and miliary TB, and in immunocompromised children. None of the tests evaluated had sufficiently high sensitivity to be used as a rule-out test in children with suspected TB.', 'As a follow-up of the ""spoligoriftyping"" development, we present here an extension of this technique which includes the detection of isoniazid resistance-Associated mutations in a new 59-plex assay, i.e., tuberculosis-spoligo-rifampin-isoniazid typing (TB-SPRINT), running on microbead-based multiplexed systems. This assay improves the synergy between clinical microbiology and epidemiology by providing (i) mutation-based prediction of drug resistance profiles for patient treatment and (ii) genotyping data for tuberculosis (TB) surveillance. This third-generation microbead-based high-throughput assay for TB runs on the Luminex 200 system and on the recently launched MagPix system (Luminex, Austin, TX). Spoligotyping patterns obtained by the TB-SPRINT method were 100% (n85 isolates; 3,655/3,655 spoligotype data points) concordant with those obtained by microbead- based and membrane-based spoligotyping. Genetic drug susceptibility typing provided by the TB-SPRINT method was 100% concordant with resistance locus sequencing (n162 for rpoB gene sequencing and n76 for katG and inhA sequencing). Considering phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) as the reference method, the sensitivity and specificity of TBSPRINT regarding Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (n162 isolates) rifampin resistance were both 100%, and those for isoniazid resistance were 90.4% (95% confidence interval, 85 to 95%) and 100%, respectively. Used routinely in national TB reference and specialized laboratories, the TB-SPRINT assay should simultaneously improve personalized medicine and epidemiological surveillance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. This assay is expected to play an emerging role in public health in countries with heavy burdens of MDR TB and/or HIV/TB coinfection. Application of this assay directly to biological samples, as well as development for extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB detection by inclusion of second-line antituberculosis drug-Associated mutations, is under development. With bioinformatical methods and data mining to reduce the number of targets to the most informative ones, locally adapted formats of this technique can easily be developed everywhere.']"

In the current study, we attempted to replicate and expand these findings by including a healthy control sample and separating the patients in a depressive episode into two groups: unipolar and bipolar depression. We hypothesized that the connections between those major nodes of the resting state networks would demonstrate different patterns in the three patient groups compared to the healthy subjects.  Resting-state functional MRI was performed on a sample of 101 participants, of which 26 patients with schizophrenia (current psychotic episodes), 24 subjects with Bipolar Disorder (B-D), 33 with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (both BD and MDD patients were in a current depressive episode), and 21 healthy controls. Spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling was used to calcu-late the coupling values between eight regions of interest, including the anterior precuneus (PRC), anterior hippocampus, anterior insula, angular gyrus, lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC), middle frontal gyrus, planum temporale, and anterior thalamus. &  We identified disturbed effective connectivity from the left lateral or-bitofrontal cortex to the left anterior precuneus that differed significantly between unipolar depres-sion, where the influence was inhibitory, and bipolar depression, where the effect was excitatory. A logistic regression analysis correctly classified 75% of patients with unipolar and bipolar depression based solely on the coupling values of this connection. In addition, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated negative effective connectivity from the anterior PRC to the lateral OFC, which distinguished them from healthy controls and patients with major depression. Future studies with unmedicated patients will be needed to establish the replicability of our findings.', 'Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations), negative symptoms (e.g., social withdrawal), and disorganized symptoms (e.g., thought disorder). Alongside these, cognitive and depressive symptoms often emerge, with depressive symptoms sometimes dominating the clinical picture. Understanding the factors that influence the development of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia could clarify the dynamics between depressive and psychotic symptoms and guide clinical interventions.  A total of 105 patients with schizophrenia (66 women, 39 men) were assessed using several clinical scales: PANSS, BPRS, DOCS, DES, HAM-D, and the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery for cognitive evaluation. Statistical analyses, including correlation and regression, were conducted using SPSS to determine the significance of associations.  Disorganized and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were identified as primary factors associated with depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Conversely, a longer duration of untreated psychosis was linked to a lower severity of depressive symptoms, suggesting that early intervention may alter the depressive symptom trajectory.  Here, we suggest a complex interaction between psychotic and depressive symptoms, possibly indicating a biological antagonism. The association of depressive symptoms with disorganized and obsessive-compulsive features may reflect an adaptive psychological response, attempting to stabilize amidst the disintegration of schizophrenia. These insights support a more integrated approach to treatment, addressing both psychotic and depressive symptoms to improve patient outcomes.', 'Schizophrenia is a mental illness with diverse clinical presentation, in which a significant proportion of patients show resistance to treatment. In patients with schizophrenia, symptoms from all psychotic and affective spectra are observed. On the one hand, affective symptoms determine the clinical course of schizophrenia and on the other hand, depressive symptoms are some of the most common ones in psychiatry in general. These data give us reason to explore the impact of depressive symptoms on the course of schizophrenia and its relationship with resistance to treatment. Method: A study of 105 patients with schizophrenia was performed. Of these, 39 were male and 66 were female. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment carried out at 12 weeks of therapy showed that 45 were resistant to schizophrenia and the remaining 60 were in clinical remission. The clinical evaluation of the patients was performed with the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) scales. The assessment of depressive complaints was conducted with the Hamilton Depression Scale.  Our study showed that in the analysis of depressive complaints with the Hamilton scale females got 12.55 points, and males got 11.44 points. We found a correlation of depressive complaints with the evaluation on the PANSS and BPRS scales, and in the analysis on the individual subscales we found a correlation on the subscale for positive and disorganized symptoms and no correlation on the scale for negative symptoms. We established a difference in the level of depression in patients with resistance in whom the level of depressive complaints was 13.82, while in those in clinical remission it was 10.87 points.  The level of depressive symptoms in patients with resistant schizophrenia is higher than in clinical remission. Depressive symptoms correlate with positive and disorganized symptoms on the PANSS scale, but not with negative symptoms. Gender is not a determining factor in depressive complaints.']"

Addition of waste cooking oils, disposal of which could cause damage to health or the environment, as a third substrate for digestion, is suggested as an approach not only to help handle the increasing volume of food waste worldwide but also to improve process performance. In the present study, waste cooking oil, in a concentration of 5%, appeared to be a positive modulator of anaerobic digestion with the production of hydrogen and did not lead to inhibition of the hydrolysis phase. The overall efficiency of the two-stage anaerobic digestion of the mixture, which contains mainly lignocellulose waste, is positively dependent on thermochemical pretreatment with the alkali reagent (Ca(OH)2), but elevated temperature (55 °C) and cooking oil addition revealed the opportunity to omit the pre-treatment step. Nevertheless, the overall energy production was lower due to the methane production step. However, the addition of waste cooking oils to the process in which lig-nocellulose is not pretreated (V3) led to an increase in the methane production and energy yield compared to V1. The anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic waste is a complex process and comprises successive degradation pathways and syntrophic microbial associations’ activities, so the division in two reactors ensured suitable conditions for the microorganisms residing in each of them. In this study, along with the production of hydrogen and methane and the separation of the hydrolysis and methanogenesis stages, utilization of agriculture- and kitchen-generated wastes was realized in the context of waste-to-energy sustainable production methods.', 'Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a microbially-driven process enabling energy production. Microorganisms are the core of anaerobic digesters and play an important role in the succession of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis processes. The diversity of participat-ing microbial communities can provide new information on digester performance for biomass val-orization and biofuel production. In this study anaerobic systems were used, operating under mes-ophilic conditions that realized biodegradation processes of waste wheat straw pretreated with NaOH—a renewable source for hydrogen and methane production. These processes could be man-aged and optimized for hydrogen and methane separately but combining them in a two-stage system can lead to higher yields and a positive energy balance. The aim of the study was to depict a process of biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic waste followed by a second one leading to the production of biomethane. Archaeal and bacterial consortia in a two-stage system operating with wheat straw were identified for the first time and the role of the most important representatives was elucidated. The mixed cultures were identified by the molecular-biological methods of meta-genomics. The results showed that biohydrogen generation is most probably due to the presence of Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans, which was 28.2% to 45.4% of the microbial community in the first and the second bioreactor, respectively. Archaeal representatives belonging to Methanobacterium for-micicum (0.71% of the community), Methanosarcina spelaei (0.03%), Methanothrix soehngenii (0.012%), and Methanobacterium beijingense (0.01%) were proven in the methane-generating reactor. The cor-relation between substrate degradation and biogas accumulation was calculated, together with the profile of fatty acids as intermediates produced during the processes. The hydrogen concentration in the biogas reached 14.43%, and the Methane concentration was 69%. Calculations of the energy yield during the two-stage process showed 1195.89 kWh·t−1 compared to a 361.62 kWh·t−1 cumula-tive yield of energy carrier for a one-stage process.', 'The main purpose of this study was to identify the microbial communities (bacterial, archaeal and fungal) in a two-stage system of anaerobic bioreactors for the production of hydrogen and methane from the waste substrate—corn steep liquor. Wastes from the food industry are valuable resources with potential in biotechnological production because of their high organic matter contents. In addition, the production of hydrogen and methane, volatile fatty acids, reducing sugars and cellulose content was monitored. Two-stage anaerobic biodegradation processes were performed by microbial populations in the first hydrogen generating bioreactor (working volume of 3 dm3) and in the second methane-generating reactor (working volume of 15 dm3). Cumulative hydrogen yield reached 2000 cm3 or 670 cm3/L a day, while the methane production reached a maximum quantity of 3300 cm3 or 220 cm3/L a day. Microbial consortia in anaerobic digestion systems play an essential role for process optimization and biofuel production enhancement. The obtained results showed the possibility of conducting two separate processes—the hydrogenic (hydrolysis and acidogenesis) and methanogenic (acetogenesis and methanogenesis)—as two stages of anaerobic digestion to favor energy production under controlled conditions with corn steep liquor. The diversity of microorganisms as main participants in the processes in the bioreactors of the two-stage system was followed using metagenome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The obtained metagenomic data showed that the most abundant phylum in both bacterial communities was Firmicutes—58.61% and 36.49% in bioreactors 1 and 2, respectively. Phylum Actinobacteria were found in significant quantities (22.91%) in the microbial community in Bioreactor 1, whereas in Bioreactor 2, they were 2.1%. Bacteroidetes are present in both bioreactors. Phylum Euryarchaeota made up 0.4% of the contents in the first bioreactor and 11.4% in the second. As the dominant genera among methanogenic archaea are Methanothrix (8.03%) and Methanosarcina (3.39%), the main fungal representatives were Saccharomyces cerevisiae. New knowledge of anaerobic digestion mediated by novel microbial consortia could be widely used to convert different wastes to green energy.']"

Although individually rare, together, rare diseases affect a significant part of the population (27-36 million people in the EU). Therefore, patient access to orphan medicines is receiving increasing political attention in the EU. In order to assess the differences in availability of reimbursed orphan medicines among Serbia, Bulgaria and Sweden, National Reimbursement Lists were reviewed and identified orphan medicines were crossed with the List of orphan drugs in Europe, published in July 2011, available from Orphanet. The analysis of regulatory traits was based mainly on a review of the official documents setting out legislation regarding rare diseases and orphan medicines in the studied countries. Only 6.5% (4 out of 61) of the authorised orphan medicines in Europe with prior orphan designation and 25.0% (17 out of 68) without prior orphan designation were available and reimbursed in Serbia. In the Bulgarian Positive Drug List 44.3% (27 out of 61) of the drugs with prior orphan designation and 50.0% (34 out of 68) without prior orphan designation were identified. The share of reimbursed orphan medicines was the highest in Sweden among the observed countries - 52.5% (32 out of 61) of the medicines with orphan designation and 60.3% (41 out of 61) without prior orphan designation. According to the first level of the ATC Classification System, most of the reimbursed orphan medicines in the three studied countries belonged to the group L: ""Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents"", while the most common indications for authorised and reimbursed orphan medicines were ""Neoplasms"" (C00-D48), with 19 available orphan drugs in Serbia, 26 in Sweden and 31 in Bulgaria. Inequities in the access to orphan medicines among Serbia, Bulgaria and Sweden may be explained by the differences in the approaches for registration, pricing and reimbursement of orphan medicines. The low share of reimbursed orphan drugs in Serbia may be due to incomplete compliance with EU legislation and existence of domestic procedure for authorisation as well. The EU legislation and policy on treatment of rare diseases obviously facilitate the penetration of orphan drugs on the EU market, but apparently there is also considerable budget impact on the availability of reimbursed orphan medicines.', 'The aim of this study was to review the requirements for the reimbursement of biosimilars and to compare the reimbursement status, market share, and reimbursement costs of biosimilars in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.  A questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from the following CEE countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The requirements for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilars were reviewed for each country. Data on the extent of reimbursement of biologic drugs (separately for original products and biosimilars) in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected for each country, along with data on the total pharmaceutical and total public health care budgets.  Our survey revealed that no specific criteria were applied for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilars in the selected CEE countries; the price of biosimilars was usually reduced compared with original drugs and specific price discounts were common. Substitution and interchangeability were generally allowed, although in most countries they were at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment. Original biologic drugs and the corresponding biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed. The reimbursement rate of biosimilars in the majority of the countries was the same and amounted to 100%. Generally, the higher shares of expenditures were shown for the reimbursement of original drugs than for biosimilars, except for filgrastim, somatropin, and epoetin (alfa and zeta). The shares of expenditures on the reimbursement of biosimilar products ranged from 8.0% in Estonia in 2014 to 32.4% in Lithuania in 2015, and generally increased in 2015. The share of expenditures on reimbursement of biosimilars in the total pharmaceutical budget differed between the countries, with the highest observed value for Slovakia and Hungary and the lowest-for Croatia.  The requirements for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilar products as well as the access of patients to biologic treatment do not differ significantly between the considered CEE countries. Biosimilar drugs significantly influence the reimbursement systems of these countries, and the expenditure on the reimbursement of biosimilars is increasing as they are becoming more accessible to patients.', 'The aim of the study was to compare the access of patients with rare diseases (RDs) to biotechnological drugs in several Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). We focused on the legislative pricing and reimbursement requirements, availability of biotechnological orphan medicinal products (BOMPs) for RDs, and reimbursement expenditures.  A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among experts from 10 CEECs: Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, and Macedonia. The legal requirements for reimbursement and pricing of BOMPs were collected. All BOMPs and medicines without prior orphan designations were extracted from the European list of orphan medicinal products, 2017. The reimbursement status of these medicinal products in 2017 in the public coverage of the included CEECs as well as the share of their costs in relation to the total public pharmaceutical spending for the period from 2014 to 2016 were defined.  Our survey revealed that some differences in the legal requirements for pricing and reimbursement of BOMPs amongst the countries included in the study. All European Union countries have developed and implemented pharmacoeconomic guidelines with or without some specific reimbursement requirements for orphan medicinal products. Cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, Markov models, meta-analysis, and discount levels of costs and results were required only in Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary. The number of reimbursed BOMPs and biotechnological medicinal products for RDs without prior orphan designation was the highest in Hungary (17 and 40, respectively). Patient-based reimbursement schemes were available only in Hungary for 11 out of 17 BOMPs. Poland and Greece have the highest pharmaceutical expenditure of reimbursed BOMPs with are ~214 million and 180 million EUR, respectively in the observed period from 2014 to 2016. High proportion of the pharmaceutical expenditure on the reimbursed biotechnological medicinal products for RDs for the observed period 2014-2016 is presented in Bulgaria and Slovakia.  The non-European Union CEECs face a significant delay in the legal implementation of pharmacoeconomic guideline for assessment of BOMPs. The access to BOMPs is similar among the observed CEECs and the countries with the best access are Hungary and Greece. The influence of BOMP expenditures on the budget in the individual countries is significant.']"

This single-center prospective cohort study from Bulgaria included 120 in-patient COVID-19 subjects of whom 70 had CKD and 50 normal renal function. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease were statistically more prevalent in the CKD group as compared to the non-CKD group.

The purpose of the current study is to systematically review and meta-analyze levels of TRP, its competing amino acids (CAAs) and TRYCATs in patients with severe affective disorders.  PubMed, Google Scholar and SciFinder were searched in the present study and we recruited 35 studies to examine 4647 participants including 2332 unipolar (MDD) and bipolar (BD) depressed patients and 2315 healthy controls. Severe patients showed significant lower (p < 0.0001) TRP (standardized mean difference, SMD = −0.517, 95% confidence interval, CI: −0.735; −0.299) and TRP/CAAs (SMD = −0.617, CI: −0.957; −0.277) levels with moderate effect sizes, while no significant difference in CAAs were found.

Activation of these pathways may be associated with activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway by inducing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO, the rate-limiting enzyme) leading to depletion of tryptophan (TRP) and increases in tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs).

The KYN/TRP ratio, frequently used as an index of IDO activity, and neurotoxicity indices based on downstream TRYCATs were unaltered or even lowered in MDD/BD.  Our findings suggest that MDD and BD are accompanied by TRP depletion without IDO and TRYCAT pathway activation. Lowered TRP availability is probably the consequence of lowered serum albumin during the inflammatory response in affective disorders.', 'Long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID) is associated with physio-somatic (chronic fatigue syndrome and somatic symptoms) and affective (depression and anxiety) symptoms. The severity of the long COVID physio-affective phenome is largely predicted by increased peak body temperature (BT) and lowered oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the acute infectious phase. This study aims to delineate whether the association of BT and SpO2 during the acute phase and the long COVID physio-affective phenome is mediated by neurotoxicity (NT) resulting from activated immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways.  We recruited 86 patients with long COVID (3–4 months after the acute phase) and 39 healthy controls and assessed serum C-reactive protein (CRP), caspase 1, interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-18, IL-10, myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and calcium (Ca), as well as peak BT and SpO2 during the acute phase.  Cluster analysis revealed that a significant part (34.9%) of long COVID patients (n = 30) show a highly elevated NT index as computed based on IL-1β, IL-18, caspase 1, CRP, MPO, and AOPPs. Partial least squares analysis showed that 61.6% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of long COVID could be explained by the NT index, lowered Ca, and peak BT/SpO2 in the acute phase and prior vaccinations with AstraZeneca or Pfizer. The most important predictors of the physio-affective phenome are Ca, CRP, IL-1β, AOPPs, and MPO.  The infection–immune–inflammatory core of acute COVID-19 strongly predicts the development of physio-affective symptoms 3–4 months later, and these effects are partly mediated by neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways.']"

In the present study, 43 strains were isolated from different plant-based fermented foods and identified by molecular methods. The species found were distinctively specific according to the food source. Only six Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains, all isolated from sauerkraut, showed the ability to produce exopolysaccharide (EPS). The utilization of glucose, fructose and sucrose was explored with regard to EPS and biomass accumulation by the tested strains. Sucrose was clearly the best carbon source for EPS production by most of the strains, yielding up to 211.53 mg/L by strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ZE2, while biomass accumulation reached the highest levels in the glucose-based culture medium. Most strains produced similar levels of EPS with glucose and fructose, while fructose was utilized more poorly for biomass production, yielding about 50% of biomass compared to glucose for most strains. Composition analysis of the EPSs produced by strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ZE2 from glucose (EPS-1) and fructose (EPS-2) revealed that glucose (80–83 mol%) and protein (41% w/w) predominated in both analyzed EPSs. However, the yield of EPS-1 was twice higher than that of EPS-2, and differences in the levels of all detected sugars were found, which shows that even for the same strain, EPS yield and composition vary depending on the carbon source. These results may be the basis for the development of tailored EPS-producing starter cultures for food fermentations, as well as technologies for the production of EPS for various applications.', 'Rhizopus arrhizus is a potential microorganism for lipase production. Solid-state fermentation is used for microbial biosynthesis of enzymes, due to advantages, such as high productivity, utilization of abundant and low-cost raw materials, and production of enzymes with different catalytic properties.  The objective of the research is optimization of the conditions for lipase production in solid-state fermentation by Rhizopus arrhizus in a nutrient medium, containing agroindustrial wastes. Method: Biosynthesis of lipase in solid-state fermentation by Rhizopus arrhizus was investigated. The effect of different solid substrates, additional carbon and nitrogen source, particles size and moisture content of the medium on enzyme production was studied. Response surface methodology was applied for determination of the optimal values of moisture content and tryptone concentration. A procedure for efficient lipase extraction from the fermented solids was developed.  Highest lipase activity was achieved when wheat bran was used as a solid substrate. The addition of 1% (w/w) glucose and 5% (w/w) tryptone to the solid medium significantly increased lipase activity. The structure of the solid medium including particles size and moisture content significantly influenced lipase production. A mathematical model for the effect of moisture content and tryptone concentration on lipase activity was developed. Highest enzyme activity was achieved at 66% moisture and 5% (w/w) tryptone. The addition of the non-ionic surfactant Disponyl NP 3070 in the eluent for enzyme extraction from the fermented solids increased lipase activity about three folds.  After optimization of the solid-state fermentation the achieved 1021.80 U/g lipase activity from Rhizopus arrhizus was higher and comparable with the activity of lipases, produced by other fungal strains. The optimization of the conditions and the use of low cost components in solid-state fermentation makes the process economicaly effective for production of lipase from the investigated strain Rhizopus arrhizus.', 'An exo-inulinase from strain Bacillus sp.

The pH optimum is at pH 7.0 and the enzyme is stable between pH 6.0 and pH 7.5, while retaining 100% of its initial activity between pH 6.5 and pH 7.0. The temperature optimum for the purified inulinase from strain Bacillus sp. SG7 was at 60°C. In the presence of inulin the purified inulinase sustains its activity at 100% for 55 minutes at 65°C. After the 70th minute the residual activity is 63% of the initial. The enzyme showed capacity to hydrolyse sucrose, raffinose and inulin from which it liberated only fructose units showing, therefore, an exo-action mechanism. The inulins from chicory (Cichorium intibus), from dahlia (Dahlia pinnata) and Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) roots were hydrolysed by the purified enzyme.']"

Since its full activation is accompanied by a number of adverse effects, researchers focus on discovery of novel compounds with ligand-receptor interaction patterns of PPARγ partial agonists. Molecular modelling is an appropriate way to achieve this goal. In this study we aimed at optimization of the docking algorithm for structure-based investigation of PPARγ partial agonists. A dataset with structures and activities of PPARγ partial agonists was constructed. A comparative study of different scoring functions' performance was conducted by redocking the partial agonists' structures selected from experimentally resolved 3D structures of PPARγ protein-ligand complexes. The docking protocols' performance regarding pose scoring, reproducibility and interpretability in the context of the collected activity data was estimated. An optimized docking protocol was developed to successfully correlate the docking scores of the studied compounds with their experimentally derived activity values and to provide the best matching degree with their experimental binding modes. Overall, these results could be useful for further molecular modelling studies of novel PPARγ partial agonists by selection of reliable docking poses to predict their binding mode and for ranking them in respect to their agonistic activity using the calculated docking scores."", 'The lack of medication to treat COVID-19 is still an obstacle that needs to be addressed by all possible scientific approaches. It is essential to design newer drugs with varied approaches. A receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key part of SARS-CoV-2 virus, located on its surface, that allows it to dock to ACE2 receptors present on human cells, which is followed by admission of virus into cells, and thus infection is triggered. Specific receptor-binding domains on the spike protein play a pivotal role in binding to the receptor. In this regard, the in silico method plays an important role, as it is more rapid and cost effective than the trial and error methods using experimental studies. A combination of virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular simulations and machine learning techniques are applied on a library of natural compounds to identify ligands that show significant binding affinity at the hydrophobic pocket of the RBD. A list of ligands with high binding affinity was obtained using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for protein–lig-and complexes. Machine learning (ML) classification schemes have been applied to obtain features of ligands and important descriptors, which help in identification of better binding ligands. A pleth-ora of descriptors were used for training the self-organizing map algorithm. The model brings out descriptors important for protein–ligand interactions.', 'Virtual or in silico ligand screening combined with other computational methods is one of the most promising methods to search for new lead compounds, thereby greatly assisting the drug discovery process. Despite considerable progresses made in virtual screening methodologies, available computer programs do not easily address problems such as: structural optimization of compounds in a screening library, receptor flexibility/induced-fit, and accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions. It has been shown that structural optimization of chemical compounds and that post-docking optimization in multi-step structure-based virtual screening approaches help to further improve the overall efficiency of the methods. To address some of these points, we developed the program AMMOS for refining both, the 3D structures of the small molecules present in chemical libraries and the predicted receptor-ligand complexes through allowing partial to full atom flexibility through molecular mechanics optimization.  The program AMMOS carries out an automatic procedure that allows for the structural refinement of compound collections and energy minimization of protein-ligand complexes using the open source program AMMP. The performance of our package was evaluated by comparing the structures of small chemical entities minimized by AMMOS with those minimized with the Tripos and MMFF94s force fields. Next, AMMOS was used for full flexible minimization of protein-ligands complexes obtained from a mutli-step virtual screening. Enrichment studies of the selected pre-docked complexes containing 60% of the initially added inhibitors were carried out with or without final AMMOS minimization on two protein targets having different binding pocket properties. AMMOS was able to improve the enrichment after the pre-docking stage with 40 to 60% of the initially added active compounds found in the top 3% to 5% of the entire compound collection.  The open source AMMOS program can be helpful in a broad range of in silico drug design studies such as optimization of small molecules or energy minimization of pre-docked protein-ligand complexes. Our enrichment study suggests that AMMOS, designed to minimize a large number of ligands pre-docked in a protein target, can successfully be applied in a final post-processing step and that it can take into account some receptor flexibility within the binding site area.']"

The present research aims to investigate the phenolic content, antioxidant activity and in vitro anti-inflammatory and antitumor potential of six propolis samples from three regions of Bulgaria (Vidin, Gabrovo and Lovech).  the analysis of propolis phenolic compounds was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); the antioxidant activity of ethanolic propolis extracts was assessed by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay; the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by the inhibition of albumin denaturation method; the in vitro antitumor activity was determined in human metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 using 3-(4,5-Dimethyl -2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.  The ethanolic propolis extracts exhibited the total phenolic content from 190.4 to 317.0 mg GAE/g, total flavonoid content from 53.4 to 79.3 mg QE/g and total caffeic acid derivatives content from 5.9 to 12.1 mg CAE/g. The studied propolis extracts showed significant antioxidant capacity (between 1000.3 and 1606.0 mM TE/g determined by the DPPH assay, and between 634.1 and 1134.5 mM TE/g determined by the FRAP assay). The chemical composition analysis indicated high concentrations of caffeic acid benzyl ester, chrysin, pinocembrin and pinobanksin-3-O-propionate, predominantly in three of the propolis samples originating from Gabrovo and Lovech regions. All propolis samples demonstrated promising in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, expressed as the inhibition of thermally induced albumin denaturation by 73.59% to 78.44%, which was higher than that of the conventional anti-inflammatory drugs Aspirin (58.44%) and Prednisolone Cortico (57.34%). The propolis samples exhibited high in vitro cytotoxicity against cancer cells MDA-MB-231 with IC50 values ranging between 9.24 and 13.62 µg/mL as determined by MTT assay.  Overall, we can suggest that the high phenolic content of Bulgarian propolis from respective areas contributes to its enhanced antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activity. Taken together, our results support the beneficial properties of Bulgarian propolis, with potential application as a promising therapeutic agent.', ""Stroke is the world's second-leading cause of death. Current treatments for cerebral edema following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mainly involve hyperosmolar fluids, but this approach is often inadequate. Propolis, known for its various beneficial properties, especially antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, could potentially act as an adjunctive therapy and help alleviate stroke-associated injuries. The chemical composition of Geniotrigona thoracica propolis extract was analyzed by GC-MS after derivatization for its total phenolic and total flavonoid content. The total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the propolis extract were 1037.31 ± 24.10 μg GAE/mL and 374.02 ± 3.36 μg QE/mL, respectively. By GC-MS analysis, its major constituents were found to be triterpenoids (22.4% of TIC). Minor compounds, such as phenolic lipids (6.7% of TIC, GC-MS) and diterpenic acids (2.3% of TIC, GC-MS), were also found. Ninety-six Sprague Dawley rats were divided into six groups; namely, the control group, the ICH group, and four ICH groups that received the following therapies: mannitol, propolis extract (daily oral propolis administration after the ICH induction), propolis-M (propolis and mannitol), and propolis-B+A (daily oral propolis administration 7 days prior to and 72 h after the ICH induction). Neurocognitive functions of the rats were analyzed using the rotarod challenge and Morris water maze. In addition, the expression of NF-κB, SUR1-TRPM4, MMP-9, and Aquaporin-4 was analyzed using immunohistochemical methods. A TUNEL assay was used to assess the percentage of apoptotic cells. Mannitol significantly improved cognitive-motor functions in the ICH group, evidenced by improved rotarod and Morris water maze completion times, and lowered SUR-1 and Aquaporin-4 levels. It also significantly decreased cerebral edema by day 3. Similarly, propolis treatments (propolis-A and propolis-B+A) showed comparable improvements in these tests and reduced edema. Moreover, combining propolis with mannitol (propolis-M) further enhanced these effects, particularly in reducing edema and the Virchow-Robin space. These findings highlight the potential of propolis from the Indonesian stingless bee, Geniotrigona thoracica, from the Central Tapanuli region as a neuroprotective, adjunctive therapy."", 'The chemical composition of stingless bee honey and propolis depends on the plant sources they are derived from, and thus reflects the flora available in the vicinity of the hives, the preferences of the bee species, and the climate (altitude and temperature). To understand the relative influence of these factors, we studied the composition of honey and propolis of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. Samples from 24 colonies were analyzed: 12 each from two S. mexicana meliponaries located in the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico, approximately 8.5 km apart, Tuxtla Chico and Cacahoatán. The chemical composition of honey and propolis was studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The antioxidant activity of propolis was also studied. Chemometric analyses were applied. The Tuxtla Chico honey samples contained higher concentrations of glucose and fructose, while the Cacahoatán samples displayed a rich composition of di- and trisaccharides. These differences can be attributed to the distinct nectar sources utilized by the bees at each location. Propolis compositions in the two locations also demonstrated qualitative differences, indicating a specific choice of resins by the bees. The observed substantial variations in the chemical composition of propolis and honey of S. mexicana from two locations relatively close to each other supports the assumption that bee species cannot be considered the most important factor in determining their chemistry.']"

Twenty-three new susceptibility loci were identified at association P < 5 × 10 â '8; 15 variants were identified among men of European ancestry, 7 were identified in multi-ancestry analyses and 1 was associated with early-onset prostate cancer.

We evaluated whether including additional SNPs in a prostate cancer polygenic hazard score (PHS) would improve associations with clinically significant prostate cancer in multi-ancestry datasets.  In total, 299 SNPs previously associated with prostate cancer were evaluated for inclusion in a new PHS, using a LASSO-regularized Cox proportional hazards model in a training dataset of 72,181 men from the PRACTICAL Consortium. The PHS model was evaluated in four testing datasets: African ancestry, Asian ancestry, and two of European Ancestry—the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) and the ProtecT study. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated to compare men with high versus low PHS for association with clinically significant, with any, and with fatal prostate cancer. The impact of genetic risk stratification on the positive predictive value (PPV) of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer was also measured.  The final model (PHS290) had 290 SNPs with non-zero coefficients. Comparing, for example, the highest and lowest quintiles of PHS290, the hazard ratios (HRs) for clinically significant prostate cancer were 13.73 [95% CI: 12.43–15.16] in ProtecT, 7.07 [6.58–7.60] in African ancestry, 10.31 [9.58–11.11] in Asian ancestry, and 11.18 [10.34–12.09] in COSM. Similar results were seen for association with any and fatal prostate cancer. Without PHS stratification, the PPV of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer in ProtecT was 0.12 (0.11–0.14). For the top 20% and top 5% of PHS290, the PPV of PSA testing was 0.19 (0.15–0.22) and 0.26 (0.19–0.33), respectively.  We demonstrate better genetic risk stratification for clinically significant prostate cancer than prior versions of PHS in multi-ancestry datasets. This is promising for implementing precision-medicine approaches to prostate cancer screening decisions in diverse populations.', 'Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, and is a target for risk reduction strategies. The effects of alcohol consumption on prostate cancer incidence and survival remain unclear, potentially due to methodological limitations of observational studies. In this study, we investigated the associations of genetic variants in alcohol-metabolising genes with prostate cancer incidence and survival. We analysed data from 23,868 men with prostate cancer and 23,051 controls from 25 studies within the international PRACTICAL Consortium. Study-specific associations of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 alcohol-metabolising genes (Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADHs) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs)) with prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, by grade, were assessed using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively. The data across the 25 studies were meta-analysed using fixed-effect and random-effects models. We found little evidence that variants in alcohol metabolising genes were associated with prostate cancer diagnosis. Four variants in two genes exceeded the multiple testing threshold for associations with prostate cancer mortality in fixed-effect meta-analyses. SNPs within ALDH1A2 associated with prostate cancer mortality were rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91; p values = 0.002); rs12910509, HRfixed = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.003); and rs8041922 (HRfixed = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.002). These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other. In ALDH1B1, rs10973794 (HRfixed = 1.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79; p values = 0.002) was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with low-grade prostate cancer.

We evaluated the impact of 10 SNPs involved in both human liver/metabolic diseases and healthspan (interleukin-6 [IL-6] rs1800795, antisense non coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) rs1556516, SH2B3/ATXN2 rs7137828, FURIN rs17514846, TP53 rs1042522, APOC3 rs2542052, KL rs9536314, KL rs9527025, SIRT6 rs107251, FOXO3 rs2802292) on NAFLD-related metabolic and liver features in 177 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, by comparing them to 146 healthy controls. We then applied a multidimensional reduction (MDR) case-control analysis of SNP-SNP interactions, to identify the joint effect of analyzed SNPs in predicting NAFLD and associated features.  Discrete SNPs were significantly associated with individual metabolic NAFLD features, but none of them significantly associated with NAFLD diagnosis. By testing potential synergies using the MDR approach, the best combination to diagnose NAFLD (P = 0.0011) resulted in the one encompassing IL-6 rs1800795 and ANRIL rs1556516.

Liver dendritic cells (DCs) are usually tolerogenic in the sinusoidal milleu composed of immunosuppressive cytokines. In NAFLD and NASH, DCs become pro-inflammatory and modulate hepatic immune response. Murine liver DCs are three major subtypes: classical (lymphoid) cDC1 or the crosspresenters (CD8α+CD103+), classical (myeloid) cDC2 (CD11b+) and plasmacytoid pDCs (PDCA-1+Siglec-H+) and two additional subtypes or lymphoid + myeloid DCs and NKDCs. Similarly, human liver DCs are three subtypes or CD141+CLEC9A+, CD1c+ (BDCA1+) and pDCs (CD303+BDCA2+). Compared to blood human hepatic DCs are less immature and predominantly induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) and IL-4 secreting T cells (Th2). DCs polarize T cells into different Th types that are in interrelations in NAFLD/NASH. T helper 1 (Th1) (T-bet) cells are associated with adipose tissue inflammation. The differentiation of Th2 (GATA3) cells is induced by IL-4 DCs, increased in NAFLD. Similarly, Th17 cells (RORγt/ RORc) are increased in NAFLD and NASH. Tregs (FoxP3) are increased in the liver in steatosis and Th22 cells (AHR) are elevated in diabetes mellitus 2 (DM2) and adiposity.

MSCs are considered to act through multiple mechanisms to coordinate a dynamic, integrated response to liver inflammation and fibrosis, which prevents the progressive distortion of hepatic architecture. Accordingly, MSCs as well as their products have been investigated as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory and fibrotic liver diseases. In this review, we highlight the current findings on the MSC-based modulation of liver inflammation and fibrosis, and the possible use of MSCs in the therapy of immune-mediated liver pathology. We briefly describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in MSC-dependent modulation of cytokine production, phenotype and function of liver infiltrated inflammatory cells and compare effects of engrafted MSCs versus MSC-generated conditioned medium (MSC-CM) in the therapy of acute liver injury. In order to elucidate therapeutic potential of MSCs and their products in modulation of chronic liver inflammation and fibrosis, we present the current findings regarding pathogenic role of immune cells in liver fibrosis and describe mechanisms involved in MSC-dependent modulation of chronic liver inflammation with the brief overview of on-going and already published clinical trials that used MSCs for the treatment of immune mediated chronic liver diseases. The accumulating evidence shows that MSCs had a significant beneficial effect in the treatment of immune-mediated liver diseases.']"

We analyzed data on 3684 RHINESSA study participants born after the year 1990 (mean age 19, standard deviation 4), offspring of 2689 RHINE study participants. Modelled annual concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), elemental carbon (EC), and ozone (O3), and greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) were assigned to parental residential addresses in 1990, corresponding to 1–18 years prior to birth (mean: 6 years, SD: 5). We analyzed associations using generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM), with cluster-robust standard errors allowing for intra-family correlation, while adjusting for potential confounders.  Among offspring participants, 18% reported lifetime asthma, 9% active asthma, 8% asthma medication, 5% asthma attacks, and 37% any asthma symptom. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in parental residential NDVI exposure was associated with less lifetime asthma (OR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.98 per 0.3 units). Similar associations were observed for active asthma and asthma medication use. Associations of air pollution with asthma outcomes were inconclusive.  Parental exposure to residential green spaces before conception was associated with lower asthma risk in offspring.

While individual and lifestyle determinants have been researched; till date there has been no study on environmental risks such as road traffic, noise, and air pollution. As a first step toward designing a large-scale population-based survey, we aimed at exploring the overall associations of prevalent T2DM with exposures to road traffic, noise, and air pollution. A total of 513 residents of Plovdiv city, Bulgaria were recruited. Individual data on self-reported doctor-diagnosed T2DM and confounding factors were linked to objective and self-rated exposure indicators. Logistic and log-link Poisson regressions were conducted. In the fully adjusted logistic models, T2DM was positively associated with exposures to L den 71-80 dB (odds ratio (OR) = 4.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38, 14.68), fine particulate matter (PM) 2.5 25.0-66.8 μg/m 3 (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 0.28, 6.24), benzo alpha pyrene 6.0-14.02 ng/m 3 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 0.52, 5.98) and high road traffic (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.48, 4.07). L den remained a significant risk factor in the: Poisson regression model. Other covariates with consistently high multivariate effects were age, gender, body mass index, family history of T2DM, subjective sleep disturbance, and especially bedroom location. We concluded that residential noise exposure might be associated with elevated risk of prevalent T2DM.

We searched articles in English, Spanish, and Russian indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar on 24 November 2015. Qualitative synthesis was made for 13 studies, and 11 studies were included in quality effects meta-analyses. Overall, they were of high quality. Based on six studies (n≈8,790,671 participants) for road traffic noise, we found a pooled relative risk (RR) of stroke per 10 dB to be 1.01 (95 % CI: 0.96, 1.06). In the 70-75 dB noise range (versus <55 dB) RR increased to 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.74, 2.24). For air traffic noise we pooled five studies (n≈16,132,075 participants) and the RRper 10 dB was 1.01 (95 % CI: 1.00, 1.02). Road traffic group showed high heterogeneity whereas the air traffic group had none. Both groups showed evidence of publication bias. In conclusion, we have established a small but elevated risk of stroke to be associated with both road and air traffic noise exposure, but the association was statistically significant only with the latter. The effect of road traffic noise followed a non-linear trend.']"

Compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, and NMR spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations with Becke’s 3-parameter hybrid functional and 6-31+G(d,p) basis set were carried out to investigate the structural features of the ligands and Ga(III) complexes. Cytotoxic screening by MTT-dye reduction assay was carried out using cisplatin and melphalan as reference cytotoxic agents. A general formula [Ga(HL)2]NO3 for the complexes obtained was suggested. The complexes are mononuclear with the Ga(III) ions being surrounded by two ligands. The ligands acted as monoanionic tridentate (ONO) donor molecules. The analysis revealed coordination binding through deprotonated phenolic-oxygen, azomethine-nitrogen, and amide-oxygen atoms. The bioassay demonstrated that all compounds exhibited concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity at low micromolar concentrations against the acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 and T-cell leukemia SKW-3 cell lines. IC50 values of 5-bromo-derivative ligands and gallium (III) complexes are lower than those of cisplatin and much lower than these of melphalan. The coordination to gallium (III) additionally increased the cytotoxicity compared to the metal-free hydrazones.', 'Complexes of lanthanum(III) with bis-coumarins: 3,3′-benzylidene- bis(4-hydroxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one) (H2L1) and bis(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen- 3-yl)-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-methane (H2L2) were synthesized by reaction of lanthanum(III) salt and the ligands, in amounts equal to metal : ligand molar ratio of 1 : 2. The complexes were prepared by adding an aqueous solution of lanthanum(III) salt to an aqueous solution of the ligand subsequently raising the pH of the mixture gradually to circa 5.0 by adding dilute solution of sodium hydroxide. The lanthanum(III) complexes with bis-coumarins were characterized by different physicochemical methods - elemental analysis, IR-, 1H-, and 13C-NMR-spectroscopies, and mass spectral data. The spectral data of lanthanum(III) complexes were interpreted on the basis of comparison with the spectra of the free ligands. This analysis showed that in the La(III) complexes, the ligands coordinated to the metal ion through both deprotonated hydroxyl groups. On the basis of the v(C=O) red shift observed, participation oi the carbonyl groups in the coordination with the metal ion was also suggested. In the present study, we performed a cytotoxic-effects screening of the lanthanum complexes with H2L1 and H2L2 in a panel of human tumor cell lines, using the standard MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability. The panel consisted of the acute myeloid leukemia-derived HL-60 and the chronic myeloid leukemia-derived BV-173. Following a 24- hour treatment of BV-173 cells with lanthanum complex of H2L1 at 100 or 200 μM led to a DNA-laddering. The findings suggest that the observed cytotoxicity of the lanthanum complex of H2L1 on BV-173 is at least partly mediated through induction of programmed cell death.', 'Tackling antimicrobial resistance is of increasing concern in a post-pandemic world where overuse of antibiotics has increased the threat of another pandemic caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Derivatives of coumarins, a naturally occurring bioactive compound, and its metal complexes have proven therapeutic potential as antimicrobial agents and in this study a series of copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of coumarin oxyacetate ligands were synthesised and characterised by spectroscopic techniques (IR, 1H, 13C NMR, UV-Vis) and by X-ray crystallography for two of the zinc complexes. The experimental spectroscopic data were then interpreted on the basis of molecular structure modelling and subsequent spectra simulation using the density functional theory method to identify the coordination mode in solution for the metal ions in the complexes. Interestingly, the solid-state coordination environment of the zinc complexes is in good agreement with the simulated solution state, which has not been the case in our previous studies of these ligands when coordinated to silver(I). Previous studies had indicated excellent antimicrobial activity for Ag(I) analogues of these ligands and related copper and zinc complexes of coumarin-derived ligands, but in this study none of the complexes displayed antimicrobial activity against the clinically relevant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.']"

This was a multicenter study from eight fetal medicine units in which the leadership were trained at the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine in London, UK, and in which the protocols for screening, invasive testing and pregnancy management are similar. Data were obtained prospectively from women with twin pregnancy undergoing routine ultrasound examination at 11–13 weeks' gestation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise elimination was used to examine whether CVS provided a significant independent contribution to the prediction of risk of fetal loss after adjusting for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, including maternal age, racial origin and weight, method of conception, smoking status, parity, chorionicity, intertwin discordance in CRL, fetal NT ≥ 95th percentile and free β-hCG and PAPP-A multiples of the median. Similarly, within the CVS group, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the effect of the number of intrauterine needle insertions and size of the needle on the risk of fetal loss.  The study population of 8581 twin pregnancies undergoing ultrasound examination at 11–13 weeks' gestation included 316 dichorionic and 129 monochorionic twins that had CVS. First, in twin pregnancies undergoing CVS, compared to those not undergoing CVS, there was a 2-fold increased risk of fetal loss at < 24 weeks' gestation and of loss at any stage in pregnancy. Second, the factors providing a significant independent contribution to the prediction of miscarriage or fetal loss in twin pregnancy were increased maternal weight, black racial origin, monochorionicity, and more so monoamnionicity, large intertwin discordance in CRL and increased fetal NT, and, in the case of fetal loss at any stage, there was also a contribution from assisted conception and low serum PAPP-A. Third, after adjustment for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, CVS did not provide a significant contribution to the risk of fetal loss. Fourth, in twin pregnancies that had CVS, there was no significant contribution to fetal loss from the number of intrauterine needle insertions or needle size.  The 2-fold increased risk of fetal loss following CVS in twin pregnancy can, to a great extent, be explained by maternal and pregnancy characteristics rather than the invasive procedure itself."", ""We have proposed previously that the competing-risks model for prediction of pre-eclampsia (PE) based on maternal characteristics and medical history (prior model), developed in singleton pregnancies, can be extended to risk assessment for twins; in dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies with the same characteristics as in singleton pregnancies, the distribution of gestational age at delivery with PE was shifted to the left by 8 and 10 weeks, respectively. However, in a subsequent validation study, we found that, in both the training and validation datasets, the observed incidence of PE was lower than the predicted one and such overestimation of risk was particularly marked for early PE.  First, to develop a new extension of the competing-risks prior model in screening for PE by maternal demographic characteristics and medical history in twin pregnancies in a training dataset. Second, to examine the predictive performance of this model in screening for PE with delivery < 34 weeks (early PE), < 37 weeks (preterm PE) and at any gestational age (all PE) in twins in a validation dataset. Third, to demonstrate the application of screening in a mixed population of singleton and twin pregnancies.  The data for this study were obtained from two prospective non-intervention multicenter screening studies for PE in twin pregnancies at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation. The training and validation datasets consisted of 2219 and 2999 women, respectively. We used the training dataset to fit a model in which the effect of twins on shifting the distribution of gestational age at delivery with PE in singletons to the left should not be the same for all gestational ages but the shift should depend on the singleton prior mean; the effect increases with increasing prior mean. We examined the predictive performance of the model in the training and validation datasets using the area under the receiver–operating characteristics curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Data on 16 747 singleton pregnancies obtained from the Screening ProgRamme for prE-Eclampsia (SPREE) study were included to examine the performance of screening in a mixed population of singleton and twin pregnancies.  Calibration plots and calibration intercept and slope demonstrate superior predictive performance of the new model in the validation dataset. Although the AUC for twin pregnancies is lower than in singleton pregnancies, performance of screening in a mixed population of singleton and twin pregnancies is superior to that in singletons (AUC of 0.790 in a mixed population comprising 2% twins and 98% singletons compared to 0.775 in singletons). For the risk cut-offs likely to be used in practice, all twin pregnancies screen positive using maternal characteristics and medical history.  A new competing-risks model in screening for PE by maternal risk factors in twin pregnancy has been developed and, using this model, the predicted risks for early PE, preterm PE and all PE are in relatively good agreement with the observed incidence of the disease."", ""First, to validate a previously developed model for screening for pre-eclampsia (PE) by maternal characteristics and medical history in twin pregnancies; second, to compare the distributions of mean arterial pressure (MAP), uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), serum placental growth factor (PlGF) and serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in twin pregnancies that delivered with PE to those in singleton pregnancies and to develop new models based on these results; and, third, to examine the predictive performance of these models in screening for PE with delivery at < 32 and < 37 weeks' gestation.  Two datasets of prospective non-intervention multicenter screening studies for PE in twin pregnancies at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation were used. The first dataset was from the EVENTS (Early vaginal progesterone for the preVention of spontaneous prEterm birth iN TwinS) trial and the second was from a previously reported study that examined the distributions of biomarkers in twin pregnancies. Maternal demographic characteristics and medical history from the EVENTS-trial dataset were used to assess the validity of risks from our previously developed model. The combined data from the first and second datasets were used to compare the distributional properties of log10 multiples of the median (MoM) values of UtA-PI, MAP, PlGF and PAPP-A in twin pregnancies that delivered with PE to those in singleton pregnancies and develop new models based on these results. The competing-risks model was used to estimate the individual patient-specific risks of delivery with PE at < 32 and < 37 weeks' gestation. Screening performance was measured by detection rates (DR) and areas under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve.  The EVENTS-trial dataset comprised 1798 pregnancies, including 168 (9.3%) that developed PE. In the validation of the prior model based on maternal characteristics and medical history, calibration plots demonstrated very good agreement between the predicted risks and the observed incidence of PE (calibration slope and intercept for PE < 32 weeks were 0.827 and 0.009, respectively, and for PE < 37 weeks they were 0.942 and −0.207, respectively). In the combined data, there were 3938 pregnancies, including 339 (8.6%) that developed PE and 253 (6.4%) that delivered with PE at < 37 weeks' gestation. In twin pregnancies that delivered with PE, MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF were, at earlier gestational ages, more discriminative than in singleton pregnancies and at later gestational ages they were less so. For PAPP-A, there was little difference between PE and unaffected pregnancies. The best performance of screening for PE was achieved by a combination of maternal factors, MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF. In screening by maternal factors alone, the DR, at a 10% false-positive rate, was 30.6% for delivery with PE at < 32 weeks' gestation and this increased to 86.4% when screening by the combined test; the respective values for PE < 37 weeks were 24.9% and 41.1%.  In the assessment of risk for PE in twin pregnancy, we can use the same prior model based on maternal characteristics and medical history as reported previously, but in the calculation of posterior risks it is necessary to use the new distributions of log10 MoM values of UtA-PI, MAP and PlGF according to gestational age at delivery with PE.""]"

Thus, deciphering the molecular mechanisms governing oral cancer will support the development of even better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Previous studies have linked aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) with the development of OSCC.  We combined bioinformatical and molecular methods to identify miRNAs with possible clinical significance as biomarkers in OSCC. A set of 10 miRNAs were selected via an in silico approach by analysing the 3’untranslated regions (3’UTRs) of cancer-related mRNAs such as FLRT2, NTRK3, and SLC8A1, TFCP2L1 and etc. RT-qPCR was used to compare the expression of in silico identified miRNAs in OSCC and normal tissues (n=32).  Among the screened miRNAs, miR-21-5p (p < 0.0001), miR-93-5p (p < 0.0197), miR-146b-5p (p <0.0012), miR-155-5p (p < 0.0001), miR-182-5p (p < 0.0001) were significantly overexpressed, whereas miR-133b (p < 0.05) was significantly downregulated in OSCC tissues, a scenario confirmed in two additional OSCC validation cohorts: Regina Elena National Cancer Institute (IRE cohort, N=74) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal (TCGA cohort, N=354). Initial stage tumors (T1, T2) expressed significantly higher levels of miR-133b (p < 0.0004) compared to more advanced ones (T3, T4). Also, we identified miR-93-5p (p < 0.0003), miR-133b (p < 0.0017) and miR-155-5p (p < 0.0004) as correlated with HPV-induced OSCC. The high expression of these 6 miRNAs as a signature predicted shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and could efficiently distinguish OSCC cases from healthy controls with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 with sensitivity and specificity of 0.98 and 0.6, respectively. Further target identification analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in FOXO, longevity, glycan biosynthesis and p53 cancer-related signaling pathways. Also, the selected targets were underexpressed in OSCC tissues and showed clinical significance related to overall survival (OS) and DFS. Discussion: Our results demonstrate that a novel panel consisting of miR-21-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-133b, miR-146b-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-182-5p could be used as OSCC-specific molecular signature with diagnostic and prognostic significance related to OS and DFS.', 'Recently, miRNAs have become popular molecules used as non-invasive biomarkers in cancer diseases.  The aim of the study was to explore the expression of four miRNAs isoforms: miR-31-3p, miR-196a-5p, miR-210-3p and miR-424-5p in plasma and tissue samples from patients with advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and healthy controls. Materials and methods: Fresh-frozen tumour and normal laryngeal tissue as well as plasma samples were obtained from 22 patients diagnosed with advanced LSCC. The control group included plasma samples from 21 cancer-free volunteers. Total RNA (including miRNAs) extraction, reverse transcription and real time qPCR were the laboratory techniques used in the study. The obtained results were analyzed using SPSS software v. 23.  We found that miR-31-3p, miR-196a-5p, and miR-210-3p levels were significantly elevated in laryngeal tumour tissue, but only the levels of miR-31-3p and miR-196a-5p were significantly upregulated in the plasma LSCC target group. Positive correlation was obtained for miR-31-3p (rs=0.443, p=0.039) and miR-196a-5p (rs=0.548; p=0.008) between plasma and adjacent tumour tissue LSCC samples. ROC analyses were used to evaluate the discriminative power of both miRNAs alone and in combination. The combination of miR-31-3p and miR-196a-5p showed best results with AUC=0.978 (95% CI: 0.945–1.000, p<0.001) with 100% sensitivity and 81% specificity at cut-off: RQ=2.99.  Based on this miR-31-3p and miR-196a-5p are proposed as potential biomarkers for validation in larger LSCC group and could be included in a non-invasive miRNAs set for detection of advanced LSCC.', 'The current study investigated the expression signatures of miRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC). miRNA profiling was performed using microarray in 12 LUAD and 12 LUSC samples and adjacent normal tissues. In LUAD, 107 miRNAs were significantly deregulated, whereas 235 miRNAs were deregulated in LUSC. Twenty-six miRNAs were common between the 2 cancer subtypes and 8 were prioritized for validation, in addition to 6 subtype-specific miRNAs. The RT-qPCR validation samples included 50 LUAD, 50 LUSC, and adjacent normal tissues. Eight miRNAs were validated in LUAD: 3 upregulated - miR-7-5p, miR-375-5p, miR-6785-3p, and 5 downregulated - miR-101-3p, miR-139-5p, miR-140-3p, miR-144-3p, miR-195-5p. Ten miRNAs were validated in the LUSC group: 3 upregulated - miR-7-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-650, and 7 downregulated - miR-95-5p, miR-140-3p, miR-144-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-375, miR-744-3p, and miR-4689-3p. Reactome pathway analysis revealed that the target genes of the deregulated miRNAs in LUAD were significantly enriched in cell cycle, membrane trafficking, gene expression processes, and EGFR signaling, while in LUSC, they were enriched in the immune system, transcriptional regulation by TP53, and FGFR signaling. This study identified distinct miRNA profiles in LUSC and LUAD, which are common and specific miRNAs that could be further investigated as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.']"

Antifungal susceptibility was evaluated by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC).  Fifty C. albicans isolates were susceptible to nine antifungal agents. The remaining 11 yeasts were resistant to one or more antifungals. All C. albicans were susceptible to amphotericin B with MICs 0.25 to 1 µg/mL and exhibited sensitivity to 5-fluorocytosine with MIC90 of 0.125 µg/mL. The MIC50 and MIC90 of fluconazole were 0.5 and 32 µg/mL, whereas the MIC50 and MIC90 of voriconazole were considerably lower-0.0078 and 2 µg/mL.

Anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms causing dysbiosis and endometrial bacterial colonization by unbalanced growth were additionally tested. Materials and methods: In total, 65 patients with a history of early and late miscarriages were analyzed. DNA extractions, real-time qPCR, agarose gel-electrophoresis were applied. Comparative analysis of the current with previously obtained data on the described panel in menstrual tissue samples was performed.  In 64,6% of all tested endometrial biopsies bacterial and/or viral pathogens were detected. In 49,23% of all tested samples we found bacterial, while in 15,3% - viral pathogens. These results are similar to our previous data on menstrual tissue samples of infertile women - 61,1% infected, as 48,8% had bacterial and 22,2% had viral pathogens. Gardnerella vaginalis and Ureaplasma parvum were detected in 31,25% and 3,12% of all bacterial infected endometrial biopsies, significantly lower in comparison to the estimated rate of 69,31% and 61,36% on menstrual tissue. Anaerobic and aerobic dysbiosis were detected in 53,33% and 27% of the bacterial infected endometrial samples. In 13,33% a dysbiosis with a mixed etiology was found, while in 7% a dysbiotic condition with a totally absent findings of targeted bacteria and Lactobacillus was observed. EBV, CMV, HHV6 and HHV7 were detected in 30%, 30%, 20% and 20% of the positive for viral factors endometrial biopsies and in 40%, 7,5%, 10% and 42,5% in menstrual tissue samples. In the current study 62,5% bacterial co-infection and 12,5% bacterial/viral co-infection variants were found. Infections with the rest of the target pathogens were not detected in the endometrial biopsies. In contrast to the endometrial biopsy results, Mycomplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and HSV2 were detected in our previous research on menstrual tissue samples.

Material and methods: A total of 125 vaginal Candida isolates were collected and tested. The definitive species identification was performed by VITEC2 Compact (Bio Merieux, France) using YST ID cards. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of nine antifungal agents were determined by the commercial system Micronaut-AM (Merlin Diagnostika GmbH, Germany).  Overall, 8 Candida species were established among the vaginal yeast isolates. The most common was C. albicans (77.6%), followed by C. glabrata (12%), C. krusei (4%), C. kefyr (2.4%), C. spherica (1.6%), C. lusitaniae, C. utilis, and C. sake (each one 0.8%). All C. albicans and 20 non-albicans Candida (NAC) were susceptible to nine antifungal agents. In the group of NAC, 8 isolates were resistant to fluconazole – 5 C. krusei with intrinsic resistance, 2 C. spherica, and 1 C. sake. The fluconazole MICs of C. spherica and C. sake were 32-128 μg/mL, and 16 μg/mL, respectively.  C. albicans was the main causative agent of VVC. Among NAC, C. glabrata was the predominant species. In general, vaginal C. albicans and non-albicans Candida were susceptible to azoles as well as echinocandins, amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of M/A in targeting cancerous mitochondria. Materials and  Several cancer and normal cell lines of the same origin were used. Cells were treated with different concentrations of M/A for 24 h. The cell viability, mitochondrial superoxide, mitochondrial membrane potential, and succinate were analyzed using conventional analytical tests.  M/A exhibited a highly specific suppression on cancer cell growth and viability, without adversely affecting the viability of normal cells at concentrations attainable by oral or parenteral administration in vivo. This effect was accompanied by: (i) an extremely high production of mitochondrial superoxide in cancer cells, but not in normal cells; (ii) a significant dose-dependent depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and depletion of oncometabolite succinate in cancer cells.  The anticancer effect of M/A is related to the induction of severe mitochondrial oxidative stress in cancer cells only. Thus, M/A has a potential to increase the sensitivity and vulnerability of cancer cells to conventional anticancer therapy and immune system.', 'Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive brain tumors, characterized by a pronounced redox imbalance, expressed in a high oxidative capacity of cancer cells due to their elevated glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The assessment and modulation of the redox state of glioblastoma are crucial factors that can provide highly specific targeting and treatment. Our study describes a pharmacological strategy for targeting glioblastoma using a redox-active combination drug. The experiments were conducted in vivo on glioblastoma mice (intracranial model) and in vitro on cell lines (cancer and normal) treated with the redox cycling pair menadione/ascorbate (M/A). The following parameters were analyzed in vivo using MRI or ex vivo on tissue and blood specimens: tumor growth, survival, cerebral perfusion, cellular density, tissue redox state, expression of tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1). Dosedependent effects of M/A on cell viability, mitochondrial functionality, and redox homeostasis were evaluated in vitro. M/A treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly increased survival without adverse side effects. This was accompanied by increased oxidative stress, decreased reducing capacity, and decreased cellular density in the tumor only, as well as increased cerebral perfusion and down-regulation of tNOX and TGF-β1. M/A induced selective cytotoxicity and overproduction of mitochondrial superoxide in isolated glioblastoma cells, but not in normal microglial cells. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the over-reduced state of cancer cells and impairment of their “pro-oncogenic” functionality, assessed by dose-dependent decreases in: NADH, NAD+, succinate, glutathione, cellular reducing capacity, mitochondrial potential, steady-state ATP, and tNOX expression. The safety of M/A on normal cells was compromised by treatment with cerivastatin, a non-specific prenyltransferase inhibitor. In conclusion, M/A differentiates glioblastoma cells and tissues from normal cells and tissues by redox targeting, causing severe oxidative stress only in the tumor. The mechanism is complex and most likely involves prenylation of menadione in normal cells, but not in cancer cells, modulation of the immune response, a decrease in drug resistance, and a potential role in sensitizing glioblastoma to conventional chemotherapy.', 'Redox-active substances and their combinations, such as of quinone/ascorbate and in particular menadione/ascorbate (M/A; also named Apatone®), attract attention with their unusual ability to kill cancer cells without affecting the viability of normal cells as well as with the synergistic anticancer effect of both molecules. So far, the primary mechanism of M/A-mediated anticancer effects has not been linked to the mitochondria. The aim of our study was to clarify whether this ""combination drug""affects mitochondrial functionality specifically in cancer cells. Studies were conducted on cancer cells (Jurkat, Colon26, and MCF7) and normal cells (normal lymphocytes, FHC, and MCF10A), treated with different concentrations of menadione, ascorbate, and/or their combination (2/200, 3/300, 5/500, 10/1000, and 20/2000 μM/μM of M/A). M/A exhibited highly specific and synergistic suppression on cancer cell growth but without adversely affecting the viability of normal cells at pharmacologically attainable concentrations. In M/A-treated cancer cells, the cytostatic/cytotoxic effect is accompanied by (i) extremely high production of mitochondrial superoxide (up to 15-fold over the control level), (ii) a significant decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, (iii) a decrease of the steady-state levels of ATP, succinate, NADH, and NAD+, and (iv) a decreased expression of programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) - one of the major immune checkpoints. These effects were dose dependent. The inhibition of NQO1 by dicoumarol increased mitochondrial superoxide and sensitized cancer cells to M/A. In normal cells, M/A induced relatively low and dose-independent increase of mitochondrial superoxide and mild oxidative stress, which seems to be well tolerated. These data suggest that all anticancer effects of M/A result from a specific mechanism, tightly connected to the mitochondria of cancer cells. At low/tolerable doses of M/A (1/100-3/300 μM/μM) attainable in cancer by oral and parenteral administration, M/A sensitized cancer cells to conventional anticancer drugs, exhibiting synergistic or additive cytotoxicity accompanied by impressive induction of apoptosis. Combinations of M/A with 13 anticancer drugs were investigated (ABT-737, barasertib, bleomycin, BEZ-235, bortezomib, cisplatin, everolimus, lomustine, lonafarnib, MG-132, MLN-2238, palbociclib, and PI-103). Low/tolerable doses of M/A did not induce irreversible cytotoxicity in cancer cells but did cause irreversible metabolic changes, including: (i) a decrease of succinate and NADH, (ii) depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, and (iii) overproduction of superoxide in the mitochondria of cancer cells only. In addition, M/A suppressed tumor growth in vivo after oral administration in mice with melanoma and the drug downregulated PD-L1 in melanoma cells. Experimental data suggest a great potential for beneficial anticancer effects of M/A through increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional anticancer therapy, as well as to the immune system, while sparing normal cells. We hypothesize that M/A-mediated anticancer effects are triggered by redox cycling of both substances, specifically within dysfunctional mitochondria. M/A may also have a beneficial effect on the immune system, making cancer cells ""visible""and more vulnerable to the native immune response.']"

Observations have suggested that fasciculation and elongation protein ζ-1 (FEZ1) may be implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, our current knowledge of the expression of FEZ1 in peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristic gene expression patterns of FEZ1 in peripheral blood samples from schizophrenia patients. We performed quantitative reverse-transcriptase (qRT-PCR) analysis using peripheral blood from drug-free schizophrenia patients (n = 29) and age and gender-matched general population controls (n = 24). For the identification of FEZ1 gene expression patterns, we applied a comparative threshold cycle (CT) method. A statistically significant difference of FEZ1 mRNA level was revealed in schizophrenia subjects compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0034). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first describing a down-regulation of FEZ1 gene expression in peripheral blood of patients with schizophrenia. Our results suggested a possible functional role of FEZ1 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and confirmed the utility of peripheral blood samples for molecular profiling of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. The current study describes FEZ1 gene expression changes in peripheral blood of patients with schizophrenia with significantly down-regulation of FEZ1 mRNA. Thus, our results provide support for a model of SZ pathogenesis that includes the effects of FEZ1 expression.', 'Schizophrenia is one of the major psychiatric disorders. It is a disorder of complex inheritance, involving both heritable and environmental factors. DNA methylation is an inheritable epigenetic modification that stably alters gene expression. We reasoned that genetic modifications that are a result of environmental stimuli could also make a contribution. We have performed 26 high-resolution genomewide methylation array analyses to determine the methylation status of 27,627 CpG islands and compared the data between patients and healthy controls. Methylation profiles of DNAs were analyzed in six pools: 220 schizophrenia patients; 220 age-matched healthy controls; 110 female schizophrenia patients; 110 age-matched healthy females; 110 male schizophrenia patients; 110 age-matched healthy males. We also investigated the methylation status of 20 individual patient DNA samples (eight females and 12 males. We found significant differences in the methylation profile between schizophrenia and control DNA pools. We found new candidate genes that principally participate in apoptosis, synaptic transmission and nervous system development (GABRA2, LIN7B, CASP3). Methylation profiles differed between the genders. In females, the most important genes participate in apoptosis and synaptic transmission (XIAP, GABRD, OXT, KRT7), whereas in the males, the implicated genes in the molecular pathology of the disease were DHX37, MAP2K2, FNDC4 and GIPC1. Data from the individual methylation analyses confirmed, the gender-specific pools results. Our data revealed major differences in methylation profiles between schizophrenia patients and controls and between male and female patients. The dysregulated activity of the candidate genes could play a role in schizophrenia pathogenesis.', ""Most psychiatric disorders are moderately to highly heritable. The degree to which genetic variation is unique to individual disorders or shared across disorders is unclear. To examine shared genetic etiology, we use genome-wide genotype data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17-29% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 ± 0.04 s.e.), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43 ± 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47 ± 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive disorder (0.32 ± 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and ASD (0.16 ± 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the negative control of Crohn's disease. This empirical evidence of shared genetic etiology for psychiatric disorders can inform nosology and encourages the investigation of common pathophysiologies for related disorders.""]"

(Fabaceae) using in vitro/in vivo models of liver injury. The EAS was characterized by HPLC and flavonoids (14 mg/g dw) and saponins (8 mg/g dw) were proved. The flavonoids (ASF1, ASF3 and ASF5) were isolated from the same extract and partially identified by LC-MS. In in vitro models of non-enzyme induced (Fe2+/AA) lipid peroxidation in isolated liver microsomes and CCl4-induced metabolic bioactivation and t-BuOOH-induced oxidative stress in isolated rat hepatocytes, both EAS and the flavonoids exerted similar to silybin (positive control) an antioxidant and cytoprotective activity, discerned by decreased MDA production in the microsomes and by preserved cell viability and GSH levels as well as by decreased LDH activity and MDA quantity in isolated rat hepatocytes. The antioxidant and hepatoprotective effect of EAS has been confirmed in vivo against CCl4-induced liver injury in rats. EAS restored the GSH levels and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes CAT and SOD, affected by CCl4 administration, as well as decreased the production of MDA. The effect of EAS was commensurable with those of silymarin.', 'Alginates are anionic polysaccharides present in the cell walls of brown seaweeds. Various biological activities of alginate and its derivatives have been described. In this study, we assessed the potential of alginate obtained from Ericaria crinita (formerly Cystoseira crinita) to scavenge free radicals and function as a ferric ion reductor. The anti-inflammatory effect on the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 of rats with LPS-induced systemic inflammation after 14 days of treatment was also examined. Ericaria crinita alginate showed antioxidant activities of IC50 = 505 µg/mL (DPPH) and OD700 > 2 (ferric reducing power). A significant decrease in serum levels of IL-1β was observed only in animals treated with the polysaccharide at a dose of 100 mg/kg bw. Both doses of E. crinita alginate (25 and 100 mg/kg bw) significantly reduced the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, but no statistical significance was observed in the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Our findings show the potential of E. crinita alginate to act as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. It is likely that the exhibited antioxidant ability of the polysaccharide contributes to its antiphlogistic effects. More in-depth studies are needed to fully understand the specific mechanisms and the molecular pathways involved in these activities.', 'To investigate the hepatoprotective potential of n-butanolic extract of Astragalus monspessulanus L.

Silymarin was used as a positive control. and results: The in-vitro experiments were carried out in primary isolated rat hepatocytes first incubated with CCl4 (86 μmol/l). Hepatic injury was discerned by a decrease in cell viability and cell glutathione (GSH) levels, an increase in lactate dehydrogenase leakage into the medium, and an elevation in malondialdehyde (MDA) quantity. Cell pre-incubation with EAM (1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml) significantly ameliorated the CCl4-induced liver damage. In-vivo rats were challenged orally with CCl4 (10% solution in olive oil) alone and after 7 days pre-treatment with EAM (100 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage). CCl4 damage was judged by an increased production of MDA, depletion of cell GSH, and a decrease in cell antioxidant defense system. EAM pre-treatment normalizes the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and the levels of GSH and MDA. These data are supported by the histopathological examination.  These results indicate that EAM has a similar significant protective effect, in vitro and in vivo, against CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rat as silymarin.This may be due to its antioxidant and membrane stabilizing properties.']"

Labs were required to perform their analyses using different biodosimetric assays in triage mode scoring and to rapidly report estimated radiation doses to the organizing institution. This article reports the results obtained with the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Three test samples were exposed to blinded doses of 0, 1.2 and 3.5 Gy X-ray doses (240 kVp, 13 mA,;75 keV, 1 Gy/min). These doses belong to 3 triage categories of clinical relevance: a low dose category, for no exposure or exposures inferior to 1 Gy, requiring no direct treatment of subjects; a medium dose category, with doses ranging from 1 to 2 Gy, and a high dose category, after exposure to doses higher than 2 Gy, with the two latter requiring increasing medical attention. After irradiation the test samples (no. 1, no. 2 and no. 3) were sent by the organizing laboratory to 14 centers participating in the micronucleus assay exercise. Laboratories were asked to setup micronucleus cultures and to perform the micronucleus assay in triage mode, scoring 500 binucleated cells manually, or 1,000 binucleated cells in automated/semi-automated mode. One laboratory received no blood samples, but scored pictures from another lab. Based on their calibration curves, laboratories had to provide estimates of the administered doses. The accuracy of the reported dose estimates was further analyzed by the micronucleus assay lead. The micronucleus assay allowed classification of samples in the corresponding clinical triage categories (low, medium, high dose category) in 88% of cases (manual scoring, 88%; semi-automated scoring, 100%; automated scoring, 73%). Agreement between scoring laboratories, assessed by calculating the Fleiss’ kappa, was excellent (100%) for semi-automated scoring, good (83%) for manual scoring and poor (53%) for fully automated scoring. Correct classification into triage scoring dose intervals (reference dose 60.5 Gy for doses ≤2.5 Gy, or reference dose 61 Gy for doses .2.5 Gy), recommended for triage biodosimetry, was obtained in 79% of cases (manual scoring, 73%; semi-automated scoring, 100%; automated scoring, 67%). The percentage of dose estimates whose 95% confidence intervals included the reference dose was 58% (manual scoring, 48%; semiautomated scoring, 72%; automated scoring, 60%). For the irradiated samples no. 2 and no. 3, a systematic shift towards higher dose estimations was observed. This was also noticed with the other cytogenetic assays in this intercomparison exercise. Accuracy of the rapid triage modality could be maintained when the number of manually scored cells was scaled down to 200 binucleated cells. In conclusion, the micronucleus assay, preferably performed in a semi-automated or manual scoring mode, is a reliable technique to perform rapid biodosimetry analysis in large-scale radiation emergencies.', 'Tools for radiation exposure reconstruction are required to support the medical management of radiation victims in radiological or nuclear incidents. Different biological and physical dosimetry assays can be used for various exposure scenarios to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation a person has absorbed. Regular validation of the techniques through inter-laboratory comparisons (ILC) is essential to guarantee high quality results. In the current RENEB inter-laboratory comparison, the performance quality of established cytogenetic assays [dicentric chromosome assay (DCA), cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN), stable chromosomal translocation assay (FISH) and premature chromosome condensation assay (PCC)] was tested in comparison to molecular biological assays [gamma-H2AX foci (gH2AX), gene expression (GE)] and physical dosimetry-based assays [electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), optically or thermally stimulated luminescence (LUM)]. Three blinded coded samples (e.g., blood, enamel or mobiles) were exposed to 0, 1.2 or 3.5 Gy X-ray reference doses (240 kVp, 1 Gy/min). These doses roughly correspond to clinically relevant groups of unexposed to low exposed (0–1 Gy), moderately exposed (1–2 Gy, no severe acute health effects expected) and highly exposed individuals (.2 Gy, requiring early intensive medical care). In the frame of the current RENEB inter-laboratory comparison, samples were sent to 86 specialized teams in 46 organizations from 27 nations for dose estimation and identification of three clinically relevant groups. The time for sending early crude reports and more precise reports was documented for each laboratory and assay where possible. The quality of dose estimates was analyzed with three different levels of granularity, 1. by calculating the frequency of correctly reported clinically relevant dose categories, 2. by determining the number of dose estimates within the uncertainty intervals recommended for triage dosimetry (60.5 Gy or 61.0 Gy for doses,2.5 Gy or .2.5 Gy), and 3. by calculating the absolute difference (AD) of estimated doses relative to the reference doses. In total, 554 dose estimates were submitted within the 6-week period given before the exercise was closed. For samples processed with the highest priority, earliest dose estimates/categories were reported within 5–10 h of receipt for GE, gH2AX, LUM, EPR, 2–3 days for DCA, CBMN and within 6–7 days for the FISH assay. For the unirradiated control sample, the categorization in the correct clinically relevant group (0–1 Gy) as well as the allocation to the triage uncertainty interval was, with the exception of a few outliers, successfully performed for all assays. For the 3.5 Gy sample the percentage of correct classifications to the clinically relevant group (≥2 Gy) was between 89–100% for all assays, with the exception of gH2AX. For the 1.2 Gy sample, an exact allocation to the clinically relevant group was more difficult and 0–50% or 0–48% of the estimates were wrongly classified into the lowest or highest dose categories, respectively. For the irradiated samples, the correct allocation to the triage uncertainty intervals varied considerably between assays for the 1.2 Gy (29–76%) and 3.5 Gy (17–100%) samples. While a systematic shift towards higher doses was observed for the cytogenetic-based assays, extreme outliers exceeding the reference doses 2–6 fold were observed for EPR, FISH and GE assays. These outliers were related to a particular material examined (tooth enamel for EPR assay, reported as kerma in enamel, but when converted into the proper quantity, i.e. to kerma in air, expected dose estimates could be recalculated in most cases), the level of experience of the teams (FISH) and methodological uncertainties (GE). This was the first RENEB ILC where everything, from blood sampling to irradiation and shipment of the samples, was organized and realized at the same institution, for several biological and physical retrospective dosimetry assays. Almost all assays appeared comparably applicable for the identification of unexposed and highly exposed individuals and the allocation of medical relevant groups, with the latter requiring medical support for the acute radiation scenario simulated in this exercise. However, extreme outliers or a systematic shift of dose estimates have been observed for some assays. Possible reasons will be discussed in the assay specific papers of this special issue. In summary, this ILC clearly demonstrates the need to conduct regular exercises to identify research needs, but also to identify technical problems and to optimize the design of future ILCs.', 'After large-scale radiation accidents where many individuals are suspected to be exposed to ionizing radiation, biological and physical retrospective dosimetry assays are important tools to aid clinical decision making by categorizing individuals into unexposed/minimally, moderately or highly exposed groups. Quality-controlled inter-laboratory comparisons of simulated accident scenarios are regularly performed in the frame of the European legal association RENEB (Running the European Network of Biological and Physical retrospective Dosimetry) to optimize international networking and emergency readiness in case of large-scale radiation events. In total 33 laboratories from 22 countries around the world participated in the current RENEB inter-laboratory comparison 2021 for the dicentric chromosome assay. Blood was irradiated in vitro with X rays (240 kVp, 13 mA,;75 keV, 1 Gy/min) to simulate an acute, homogeneous whole-body exposure. Three blood samples (no. 1: 0 Gy, no. 2: 1.2 Gy, no. 3: 3.5 Gy) were sent to each participant and the task was to culture samples, to prepare slides and to assess radiation doses based on the observed dicentric yields from 50 manually or 150 semi-automatically scored metaphases (triage mode scoring). Approximately two-thirds of the participants applied calibration curves from irradiations with c rays and about 1/3 from irradiations with X rays with varying energies. The categorization of the samples in clinically relevant groups corresponding to individuals that were unexposed/minimally (0–1 Gy), moderately (1–2 Gy) or highly exposed (.2 Gy) was successfully performed by all participants for sample no. 1 and no. 3 and by ≥74% for sample no. 2. However, while most participants estimated a dose of exactly 0 Gy for the sham-irradiated sample, the precise dose estimates of the samples irradiated with doses .0 Gy were systematically higher than the corresponding reference doses and showed a median deviation of 0.5 Gy (sample no. 2) and 0.95 Gy (sample no. 3) for manual scoring. By converting doses estimated based on c-ray calibration curves to X-ray doses of a comparable mean photon energy as used in this exercise, the median deviation decreased to 0.27 Gy (sample no. 2) and 0.6 Gy (sample no. 3). The main aim of biological dosimetry in the case of a large-scale event is the categorization of individuals into clinically relevant groups, to aid clinical decision making. This task was successfully performed by all participants for the 0 Gy and 3.5 Gy samples and by 74% (manual scoring) and 80% (semiautomatic scoring) for the 1.2 Gy sample. Due to the accuracy of the dicentric chromosome assay and the high number of participating laboratories, a systematic shift of the dose estimates could be revealed. Differences in radiation quality (X ray vs. c ray) between the test samples and the applied dose effect curves can partly explain the systematic shift. There might be several additional reasons for the observed bias (e.g., donor effects, transport, experimental conditions or the irradiation setup) and the analysis of these reasons provides great opportunities for future research. The participation of laboratories from countries around the world gave the opportunity to compare the results on an international level.']"

As part of the Horizon2020 HTx project, this research aimed to form recommendations for critical barriers to patient involvement in HTA in CEE countries.  Built on previous research findings on potential barriers, a prioritisation survey was conducted online with CEE stakeholders. Recommendations for prioritised barriers were formed through a face-to-face workshop by CEE stakeholders and HTx experts.  A total of 105 stakeholders from 13 CEE countries completed the prioritisation survey and identified 12 of the 22 potential barriers as highly important. The workshop had 36 participants representing 9 CEE countries, and 5 Western European countries coming together to discuss solutions in order to form recommendations based on best practices, real-life experience, and transferability aspects. Stakeholder groups involved in both phases included HTA organisation representatives, payers, patients, caregivers, patient organisation representatives, patient experts, health care providers, academic and non-academic researchers, health care consultants and health technology manufacturers/providers. As a result, 12 recommendations were formed specified to the CEE region’s context, but potentially useful for a broader geographic audience.  In this paper, we present 12 recommendations for meaningful, systematic, and sustainable patient involvement in HTA in CEE countries.

Little is known about the provision of lung cancer care across Europe. The overall aim of the Task Force was to investigate current practice in lung cancer care across Europe. The Task Force undertook four projects: 1) a narrative literature search on quality management of lung cancer; 2) a survey of national and local infrastructure for lung cancer care in Europe; 3) a benchmarking project on the quality of (inter)national lung cancer guidelines in Europe; and 4) a feasibility study of prospective data collection in a pan-European setting. There is little peer-reviewed literature on quality management in lung cancer care. The survey revealed important differences in the infrastructure of lung cancer care in Europe. The European guidelines that were assessed displayed wide variation in content and scope, as well as methodological quality but at the same time there was relevant duplication. The feasibility study demonstrated that it is, in principle, feasible to collect prospective demographic and clinical data on patients with lung cancer. Legal obligations vary among countries.

Thyroid function abnormalities can be associated with insulin resistance (IR) and changes in carbohydrate metabolism. In patients with type 1 diabetes, thyroid function is usually evaluated to rule out abnormalities within a second autoimmune disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes are tested for thyroid function in view of the associated weight gain, IR, and changes in metabolism. The question arises: Should we also look for thyroid dysfunction in patients with gestational diabetes? The aim of the study was to determine whether there are abnormalities in thyroid hormone levels in pregnant women with gestational diabetes. Material and methods: A monocentric, retrospective study of the Dr Shterev Hospital electronic database was performed. We analysed the medical records of 662 pregnant women, divided in two groups - 412 with GDM and 250 with normal glucose tolerance, who gave birth in the period 2017-2019. Gestational diabetes mellitus in the study group was diagnosed with a 2-h, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria.

A 9 MHz transducer (Fukuda Corp., Japan) for thyroid ultrasound and a 14 MHz transducer (Ultrasonix Medical Corp., Canada) for Doppler ultrasound were employed. Statistical analyses were done with the help of IBM SPSS 19.0 software.  The elevated levels of TSH receptor antibodies were observed in 6.3% of the participants (12 females and 1 male) and exclusively in hypothyroid subjects, who were either untreated (7.4%) or on levothyroxine treatment (7.6%). The highest and the lowest prevalence of positive TSH receptor antibodies were seen in patients with positive thyroglobulin antibodies & negaive thyroid peroxidase (17.6%) and positive thyroid peroxidase & negaive thyroglobulin antibodies (3.3%), respectively. Higher levels of TSH receptor antibodies were associated with a shorter duration of the disease (22 vs. 36 months), lower titers of thyroglobulin antibodies (281.2 vs. 400.9 UI/L), decreased thyroid volumes (9.4 vs. 14.2 cm3) and an increased prevalence of orbitopathy (23.1 vs. 4.1%). In the whole study population, TSH receptor antibodies levels were related to fT4 (linear R2=0.271, p=0.039), titers of thyroid peroxidase (quadratic, R2=0.048, p=0.034), and thyroid volume (compound R2=0.041, p=0.011). However, in the TSH receptor antibodies positive patients, the correlation was seen only with the levels of thyroid peroxidase (compound R2=0.503, p=0.032).  TSH receptor antibodies positivity cannot be considered negligible in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. The elevated levels of TSH receptor antibodies might result in a predisposition to a more unstable thyroid function, lower thyroid volumes, specific profiles of thyroid peroxidase, and thyroglobulin antibodies and a higher prevalence of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.']"

The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will compare the results between the countries participating in the study.  This is an international prospective cohort study, with a baseline and three follow-up assessments over a six-month period. It is being carried out in 11 European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The sample consists of adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6\u2009months of age). The assessment includes measures on COVID-19 epidemiology and public health measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset), Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE questionnaires), psychological distress (BSI-18), depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD checklist for DSM-V). DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health and well-being, including the identification of potential risk and protective factors by implementing predictive models using machine learning techniques. The findings will help policymakers develop suitable guidelines and prevention strategies for perinatal mental health and contribute to designing tailored mental health interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04595123 .', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted general medical practice by altering work structures and increasing teamwork while also adversely affecting the mental health of general practitioners and family medicine specialists. This study assesses depression, anxiety, and fear levels among general practitioners and family medicine specialists in Europe 2\u202fyears after the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset, and it explores influencing factors.  This observational cross-sectional study included participants from 13 European countries. Data was collected from May to August 2022 with an anonymous online survey incorporating validated questionnaires for depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S). Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, correlation tests, and linear regression.  A total of 1,723 participants completed the survey. Findings indicated an overall mild to moderate levels of anxiety (GAD-7: 5.4\u202f±\u202f4.76) and depression (PHQ-9: 6.33\u202f±\u202f5.43), and moderate fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19: 12.84\u202f±\u202f5.29). Key determinants of anxiety, fear, and depression included country, at-risk status, patient non-compliance, and mental health history. Sex influenced anxiety and fear, losing co-workers to COVID-19 influenced anxiety and depression, while losing relatives or friends influenced fear.  Two years into the pandemic, European general practitioners and family medicine specialists showed mild to moderate levels of anxiety, depression, and fear. Country, at-risk status, mental health history, and work-related challenges significantly affected mental health. Crucial interventions are needed to support healthcare workers during pandemics, focusing on protective measures, stable work environments, and coping strategies for anxiety and depression.', 'Despite the global impact of COVID-19, studies comparing the effects of COVID-19 on population mental health across countries are sparse. This study aimed to compare anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown among adults from 11 countries and to examine their associations with country-level COVID-19 factors and personal COVID-19 exposure. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults (≥18 years) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, North Macedonia, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Mental health (anxiety, depression, resilient coping, hope) and other study data were collected between June–August 2020. Of the 13,263 participants, 62.8% were female and 51.7% were 18–34 years old. Participants living in Brazil had the highest anxiety and depression symptoms while participants living in Singapore had the lowest. Greater personal COVID-19 exposure was associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms, but country-level COVID-19 factors were not. Higher levels of hope were associated with reduced anxiety and depression; higher levels of resilient coping were associated with reduced anxiety but not depression. Substantial variations exist in anxiety and depression symptoms across countries during the COVID-19 lockdown, with personal COVID-19 exposure being a significant risk factor. Strategies that mitigate COVID-19 exposure and enhance hope and resilience may reduce anxiety and depression during global emergencies.']"

The study aimed at further eliciting the contribution of cholinergic and nitrergic neurotransmission systems to modular nerve networks in different regions of Wistar rat anorectum. Electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0.8 ms, 40 V, 2, 5 or 10 Hz, 20 s), computerized mechanographic on-line setup and drugs were used to evaluate the motor responses of isolated rings from circular muscle of rectum (proximal, middle, and distal part), internal anal sphincter, and anal canal. Twitch-like frequency-dependent contractions, more pronounced in rectal preparations, characterized the modular motor responses of rectal circular muscle rings and anal canal. Depending on the frequency of stimulation, the motor activity of internal anal sphincter varied from deep long-lasting relaxation to initial short-lasting relaxation, followed by a contraction. Electrically-evoked responses of anorectal preparations were tetrodotoxin (0.1 μM)-sensitive. In the presence of atropine (0.3 μM) the contractions of rectal rings decreased, relaxation of internal anal sphincter increased and inhibition of the contractions of the anal canal occurred, followed by relaxation. During atropine treatment, NG-nitro-L-arginine (0.5 mM) increased the contractile responses and suppressed internal anal sphincter relaxations. L-arginine (0.5 mM) decreased the contractions and extended the relaxations of internal anal sphincter and anal canal. Our results suggest that cholinergic and nitrergic systems are not equally involved in modular nerve networks of various regions of anorectum. Cholinergic transmission is more expressed in distal rectum, underlying its contractile potency, while nitric oxide-dependent transmission(s) control the relaxation ability of the internal anal sphincter and anal canal.', 'The aim of the present study was to characterize voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from rat tail main artery in the presence of 5 mmol L-1 external Ca2+. Calcium currents were identified on the basis of their voltage dependencies and sensitivity to nifedipine, Ni2+ and cinnarizine. In the majority of the cells studied, T- and L-type currents were observed, while the remaining cells showed predominantly L-type currents. In the latter group of cells, holding potential change from -50 to either -70 or -90 mV increased the corresponding inward current amplitude while its voltage activation threshold remained unchanged. The steady state inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels showed half-maximal inactivation at -38 mV. A Ca2+-dependent inactivation was also evident. Nifedipine (3 μmol L-1) blocked L-type but not T-type Ca2+ currents. Ni2+ (50 μmol L-1) as well as cinnarizine (1 μmol L-1) suppressed the nifedipine-resistant, T-type component of the currents. At higher concentrations, both Ni2+ (0.3-1 mmol L-1) and cinnarizine (10 μmol L-1) blocked the net inward current. Replacement of Ca2+ with 10 mmol L-1 Ba2+ significantly increased the amplitude of L-type Ca2+ currents. These results demonstrate that smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from rat tail main artery may be divided into two populations, one expressing both L- and T-type and the other only L-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, this report shows that in arterial smooth muscle cells cinnarizine potently inhibited T-type currents at low concentrations (1 μmol L-1) but also blocked L-type Ca2+ currents at higher concentrations (10 μmol L-1).', 'Tacrine, a well-known acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, applied in concentrations higher than 2×10-5 mol/l promoted Ca2+-independent relaxation of rat gastric smooth muscles in experiments in vitro. The relaxation was not cholinergic and was a result of influence of tacrine over intracellular signaling pathways regulating smooth muscle contraction/relaxation. The nature of this untypical muscle relaxation was studied by using smooth muscle strips isolated from rat stomach. Their bioelectrical and mechanical responses were recorded after treatment with tacrine and different activators or blockers of intracellular pathways involved in muscle contractility. Following the activation of adenylate cyclase with 1×10-6 mol/l forskolin and increase in the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) after application of 4×10-5 mol/l SQ22536, a significant decrease in the muscle relaxation was observed. Theophylline (2×10-4 mol/l), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, had no effect on the amplitude of tacrine-induced relaxation. The latter was also reduced by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) with 5×10-6 mol/l KT5720. These findings support the assumption that tacrine promoted smooth muscle relaxation through PKA-induced phosphorylation and inhibition of myosin light chain kinase activity. The reduction of spike-linked Ca2+ influx provoked by tacrine was probably a secondary contributing process, associated with an influence of increased cAMP level on Ca2+ channels.']"

Choosing a panel of cytokines crucial for Th17/Treg differentiation and behavior, in colon specimens, as mRNA biomarkers, and their serum protein levels. We found a significant difference between higher gene expression of FoxP3, TGFb1, IL-10, and IL-23, and approximately equal level of IL-6 in CRC patients in comparison with IBD patients. After stratification of CRC patients, we found a significant difference in FoxP3, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-17A mRNA in early cases compared to IBD, and IL-23 alone in advanced CRC. The protein levels of the cytokines were significantly higher in CRC patients compared to IBD patients. Our findings showed that IL-6 upregulation is essential for both IBD and CRC development until the upregulation of other Th17/Treg related genes (TGFb1, IL-10, IL-23, and transcription factor FoxP3) is a crucial primarily for CRC development. The significantly upregulated IL-6 could be a potential drug target for IBD and prevention of CRC development as well.', ""of the study: The ability of immune cells in peripheral blood to produce certain cytokines affects tumour- elicited inflammation.

Material and methods: The venous blood for PBMC isolation was collected preoperatively and 10 days after surgery, from CRC patients. After isolation of total RNA and synthesis of cDNA, quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed.  Our results demonstrated that among investigated cytokine genes IL-10 and TGF-β were significantly upregulated in patients with CRC compared to the control group, while the expression of IL-23 mRNA was significantly decreased in CRC patients. We observed significantly increased mRNA levels in CRC patients' PBMC before surgery for IL-10 and TGF-β compared to both postoperative and control groups. We also found a significant upregulation of iNOS in early compared to advanced CRC.  Based on the results we can assume that PBMC gene expression programming in CRC patients drives local differentiation of Th cells towards Treg instead of the Th1 anti- tumour subpopulation."", 'Chronic inflammation creates tumor microenvironment (TME) that facilitates colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and tumor progression. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine with a pleiotropic effect on CRC development. We aimed to evaluate IL-6 expression in tumor cells and in immune cells in TME, to assess the serum level and IL6 -174 G/C genotype distribution and to correlate the results with selected morphologic and clinical parameters that may add useful information in understanding the mechanisms of human CRC progression. A total of 153 patients with CRC were recruited in the current study. We assessed the IL-6 serum concentration through the ELISA method, the expression of IL-6 in tumor and in immune cells by immunohistochemical and double immunofluorescence staining, the MSI status by immunоhistochemistry for 4 mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, and the genotype distributions for IL6 -174G/C (rs1800795) single-nucleotide polymorphism through PCR-RFLP method. Our results showed that serum IL-6 level were increased in CRC patients as compared with healthy controls (P<0.0001), and in patients with cancers with advanced histologic type (type IV). However, the higher concentration (above the median of 55.71 pg/mL) was with borderline association with longer survival of the patients after surgical therapy (P=0.055, Log rank test). We also found that IL-6+immune cells prevailed in the invasive front (IF) of tumors compared with the tumor stroma (TS) (P<0.0001). More IL-6+cells were recruited in the tumors with less advanced histologic type (I+II), with stronger inflammatory infiltrate in the IF, in early pTNM stages (I+II), without lymph node and distant metastases and the higher levels of IL-6+cells, especially in the IF, were associated with longer survival (P=0.012). The results of our study suggest that although the serum levels of IL-6 are higher in CRC, the increased IL-6+cells in tumor microenvironment, both in the invasive front and in tumor stroma, as well as the higher serum levels are associated with good prognostic variables and longer survival of the patients mainly in the early stages of CRC.']"

To shed further light on molecular mechanisms of its interaction with lipid membranes we study resveratrol influence on the organisation and mechanical properties of biomimetic lipid systems composed of synthetic phosphatidylcholines with mixed aliphatic chains and different degree of unsaturation at sn-2 position (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC, and 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PDPC). High-sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetric measurements reveal stronger spontaneous resveratrol association to polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine bilayers compared to the monounsaturated ones resulting from hydrophobic interactions, conformational changes of the interacting species and desolvation of molecular surfaces. The latter is supported by the results from Laurdan spectroscopy of large unilamellar vesicles providing data on hydration at the glycerol backbones of glycerophospholipides. Higher degree of lipid order is reported for POPC membranes compared to PDPC. While resveratrol mostly enhances the hydration of PDPC membranes, increasing POPC dehydration is reported upon treatment with the polyphenol. Dehydration of the polyunsaturated lipid bilayers is measured only at the highest phytoalexin content studied (resveratrol/lipid 0.5 mol/mol) and is less pronounced than the effect reported for POPC membranes. The polyphenol effect on membrane mechanics is probed by thermal shape fluctuation analysis of quasispherical giant unilamellar vesicles. Markedly different trend of the bending elasticity with increasing resveratrol concentration is reported for the two types of phospholipid bilayers studied. POPC membranes become more rigid in the presence of resveratrol, whereas PDPC-containing bilayers exhibit softening at lower concentrations of the polyphenol followed by a slight growth without bilayer stiffening even at the highest resveratrol content explored. The new data on the structural organization and membrane properties of resveratrol-treated phosphatidylcholine membranes may underpin the development of future liposomal applications of the polyphenol in medicinal chemistry.', 'Glycolipids are important components of almost all biological membranes. They possess unique properties that have only been incompletely characterized so far. The plant glycolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) strongly influences the physical behavior of phospholipid model membranes in both the dry and hydrated state. It was, however, unclear whether the strong effect of DGDG on the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm) in dry phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers is mainly due to the high degree of unsaturation of the DGDG fatty acyl chains or to interactions between the DGDG and PC headgroups. Also, no information on the relative effectiveness of membrane bound and free sugars on membrane phase behavior was available. We have used Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate the phase properties and H-bonding patterns in dry membranes made from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) containing one saturated and one monounsaturated (16:0/18:1) fatty acid and different fractions of DGDG or 1,2-dilinolenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) (18:3/18:3). This was compared to the effects of galactose (Gal) and digalactose (diGal). All additives depressed Tm of the dry membranes, but DGDG was much more effective than DLPC or Gal. diGal had a similar effect as DGDG, pointing to the sugar headgroup as the component with the strongest influence on membrane phase behavior. A combination of DLPC and diGal, which should theoretically be equivalent to DGDG, was much more effective than the galactolipid. H-bonding interactions with the P=O group of PC were also stronger for free diGal than for DGDG, indicating that the free sugar may be structurally more flexible to adopt an optimal conformation for interactions with the PC headgroup.', 'The phase behavior of mixed lipid dispersions representing the inner leaflet of the cell membrane has been characterized by X-ray diffraction. Aqueous dispersions of phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine (4:1 mole/mole) have a heterogeneous structure comprising an inverted hexagonal phase HII and a lamellar phase. Both phases coexist in the temperature range 20-45°C. The fluid-to-gel mid-transition temperature of the lamellar phase assigned to phosphatidylserine is decreased from 27 to 24°C in the presence of calcium. Addition of sphingomyelin to phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine prevents phase separation of the hexagonal HII phase of phosphatidylethanolamine but the ternary mixture phase separates into two lamellar phases of periodcity 6.2 and 5.6 nm, respectively. The 6.2-nm periodicity is assigned to the gel phase enriched in sphingomyelin of molecular species comprising predominantly long saturated hydrocarbon chains because it undergoes a gel-to-fluid phase transition above 40°C. The coexisting fluid phase we assign to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine and low melting point molecular species of sphingomyelin which suppresses the tendency of phosphatidylethanolamine to phase-separate into hexagonal HII structure. There is evidence for considerable hysteresis in the separation of lamellar fluid and gel phases during cooling. The addition of cholesterol prevents phase separation of the gel phase of high melting point sphingomyelin in mixtures with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. In the quaternary mixture the lamellar fluid phase, however, is phase separated into two lamellar phases of periodicities of 6.3 and 5.6 nm (20°C), respectively. The lamellar phase of periodicity 5.6 nm is assigned to a phase enriched in aminoglycerophospholipids and the periodicity 6.3 nm to a liquid-ordered phase formed from cholesterol and high melting point molecular species of sphingomyelin characterized previously by ESR. Substituting 7-dehydrocholesterol for cholesterol did not result in evidence for lamellar phase separation in the mixture within the temperature range 20-40°C. The specificity of cholesterol in creation of liquid-ordered lamellar phase is inferred.']"

The results of the MTT assay showed that the mucus and α-subunit of hemocyanin from the snail H. aspersa had the most significant antiproliferative activity of the tested samples. Cytomorphological analysis revealed that the observed antitumor effects were associated with induction of apoptosis in the tumor cells.

In vitro studies antitumour activities of these proteins were performed with bladder cancer permanent cell line CAL-29 and the normal urothelial cell line HL 10/29 in comparison to doxorubicin. The obtained results showed that the human tumour CAL-29 cell line is sensitive to the action of the tested hemocyanins and their isoforms. We observed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of tumour cell growth after incubation with native HlH and two FUs (βc-HlH-a and FU βc-HlH-h); and of particular significance, FU βc-HlH-h showed a surprisingly stronger effect than that the doxorubicin-treated cells. Cells treated with βc-HlH-h, showed both, apoptotic and necrotic cells. In addition, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) found for differential up-regulation of several proteins after hemocyanin treatment. Eight different down-regulated and two up-regulated proteins were identified, which may be associated with the apoptosis pathway. No inhibition of the normal urothelial cell line HL 10/29 was observed after treatment with HlH and its isoforms. The most effective inhibition of CAL-29 tumour cells was observed after treatment with βc-HlH-h, probably caused by a specific oligosaccharide structure of HlH with methylated hexoses.

With respect to MDA-MB-231 cells, ester 2 manifested the highest effect with IC50 52.56 μg/mL (IC50 0.16 μM), and 2-ethyl derivative 4 revealed IC50 62.86 μg/mL (IC50 0.24 μM). It was estimated that the effect of the substances on the cell cycle progression was due to cell cycle arrest in the G2 stage for MDA-MB-231, while arrest in G1 was detected for the estrogen (ER)-positive MCF-7 cell line. The tested compound’s effects on the change of the zeta potential in the tumorigenic cells utilized in this study were determined. The calculation which we performed of the physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic parameters influencing the biological activity suggested high intestinal absorption, as well as drug-likeness.', 'Hydrazones have versatile properties that make them promising for a range of possible applications. In this study, we examined a library of 17 aroylhydrazones derived from nicotinic acid hydrazide (1-12) and isonicotinic acid hydrazide (A-E) created by us for their biological activity. The antiproliferative activity of the compounds was investigated on non-tumour MCF-10A cells and cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Four compounds were selected as most active in cell growth inhibition of the tumour cell lines. These compounds, 5, 11, C and E, were tested on four additional cell lines: non-tumour BJ and cancer cell lines, HeLa, HepG2 and HT-29. Compounds 5 and E exhibited the highest selectivity index on cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, HeLa and HepG2. High selectivity to MCF-7 cells was demonstrated with compound 5. Compound C was very selective to HepG2 cells as well as to MDA-MB-231 but to a lesser degree. Compound 11 showed selectivity against MDA-MB-231. The obtained results allow assessing the structure–activity relationship of the compounds and provide insight into the further development of this group of aroylhydrazones as more potent and selective anti-neoplastic agents.', 'The aim of the current study was to develop and explore a series of new cytotoxic agents based on the conjugation between the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine moiety and a second pharmacophore at the C2 or N3 position.  As the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine core is a bioisostere of the 4-anilinoquinazoline, various new thienopyrimidine derivatives were synthesized by modifying the structure of the clinically used anticancer quinazoline EGFR inhibitors of the first generation – gefitinib, and second-generation – dacomitinib and canertinib. It was reported that some thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives showed improved EGFR inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the benzimidazole heterocycle is present as a pharmacophore unit in the structure of many clinically used chemotherapeutic agents. Some 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives, possessing anticancer activity, demonstrated EGFR inhibition and the benzimidazole derivative EGF816 is currently in the second phase of clinical trials.  The objectives of the study were the design of a novel series thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines, synthesis of the compounds and investigation of their effects towards human cancer HT-29, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, HepG2 and to normal human Lep3 cell lines. (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).  The synthetic protocol implemented cyclocondensation of 2-amino-thiophenes and nitriles in an inert medium, azaMichael addition to benzimidazole derivatives and nucleophylic substitution at the N3 place. MTS test was used in order to establish the cytotoxicity of the tested compounds. SAR analysis and in silico assessment of the inhibitory potential towards human oncogenicV599EB-Raf were performed using Molinspiration tool and Molecular Operating environment software.  The MTS test data showed that almost all studied thieno[2,3-d]pyirimidines (9-13, 21-22 and 25) manifest high inhibitory effect on cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations, whereas compounds 9 (IC50 = 130 nM) and 10 (IC50 = 261 nM) containing amino acid moiety, and 21 (IC50 = 108 nM) possessing two thienopyrimidine moieties attached to a 1,3-disubstituted benzimidazole linker, revealed many times lower toxicity against Lep3 cells compared to the cancer cells. Thienopyrimidines 11-13 possessed high selectivity against HeLa cells. Compound 13 showed high inhibitory activity against MDA-MB-231 and HepG2, with IC50 1.44 nM and 1.11 nM respectively. To outline the possible biological target of the studied coumpounds, their potential to interact with human oncogenicV599EB-Raf was explored by a docking study. As a result, it was suggested that the benzimidazolyl and glycyl fragments could enhance the binding ability of the new compounds by increasing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and by stabilizing the inactive form of the enzyme.  The thienopyrimidines tested in vitro for human cancer HT-29, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, HepG2 and normal human Lep3 cell lines demonstrated cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range. It was established that compounds 9, 10 and 21 showed many times lower toxicity against normal Lep3 cells that can provide a high selectivity towards all four cancer cell lines at small concentrations. Based on the analysis of the structure-activity relationship, the observed trends in the cytotoxicity could be related to the lipophilicity and the topological polar surface area of the tested compounds. The docking study on the potential of the new thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-ones to interact with mutantV599EB-Raf showed that the compounds might be able to stabilize the enzyme in its inactive form.']"

Nevertheless, recordings are often contaminated by residual power-line interference. Traditional analogue and digital filters are known to suppress ECG components near to the power-line frequency. Different types of digital notch filters are widely used despite their inherent contradiction: tolerable signal distortion needs a narrow frequency band, which leads to ineffective filtering in cases of larger frequency deviation of the interference. Adaptive filtering introduces unacceptable transient response time, especially after steep and large QRS complexes. Other available techniques such as Fourier transform do not work in real time. The subtraction procedure is found to cope better with this problem. Method: The subtraction procedure was developed some two decades ago, and almost totally eliminates power-line interference from the ECG signal. This procedure does not affect the signal frequency components around the interfering frequency. Digital filtering is applied on linear segments of the signal to remove the interference components. These interference components are stored and further subtracted from the signal wherever non-linear segments are encountered.  Modifications of the subtraction procedure have been used in thousands of ECG instruments and computer-aided systems. Other work has extended this procedure to almost all possible cases of sampling rate and interference frequency variation. Improved structure of the online procedure has worked successfully regardless of the multiplicity between the sampling rate and the interference frequency. Such flexibility is due to the use of specific filter modules.  The subtraction procedure has largely proved advantageous over other methods for power-line interference cancellation in ECG signals.', 'This study investigates the use of atrioventricular (AV) synchronization as an important diagnostic criterion for atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF) using one to twelve ECG leads. Heart rate, lead-specific AV conduction time, and P-/f-wave amplitude were evaluated by three representative ECG metrics (mean value, standard deviation), namely RR-interval (RRi-mean, RRi-std), PQ-interval (PQi-mean, PQI-std), and PQ-amplitude (PQa-mean, PQa-std), in 71,545 standard 12-lead ECG records from the six largest PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2021 databases. Two rhythm classes were considered (AF, non-AF), randomly assigning records into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) datasets. In a grid search of 19, 55, and 83 dense neural network (DenseNet) architectures and five independent training runs, we optimized models for one-lead, six-lead (chest or limb), and twelve-lead input features. Lead-set performance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) input feature importance were evaluated on the test set. Optimal DenseNet architectures with the number of neurons in sequential [1st, 2nd, 3rd] hidden layers were assessed for sensitivity and specificity: DenseNet [16,16,0] with primary leads (I or II) had 87.9–88.3 and 90.5–91.5%; DenseNet [32,32,32] with six limb leads had 90.7 and 94.2%; DenseNet [32,32,4] with six chest leads had 92.1 and 93.2%; and DenseNet [128,8,8] with all 12 leads had 91.8 and 95.8%, indicating sensitivity and specificity values, respectively. Mean SHAP values on the entire test set highlighted the importance of RRi-mean (100%), RR-std (84%), and atrial synchronization (40–60%) for the PQa-mean (aVR, I), PQi-std (V2, aVF, II), and PQi-mean (aVL, aVR). Our focus on finding the strongest AV synchronization predictors of AF in 12-lead ECGs would lead to a comprehensive understanding of the decision-making process in advanced neural network classifiers. DenseNet self-learned to rely on a few ECG behavioral characteristics: first, characteristics usually associated with AF conduction such as rapid heart rate, enhanced heart rate variability, and large PQ-interval deviation in V2 and inferior leads (aVF, II); second, characteristics related to a typical P-wave pattern in sinus rhythm, which is best distinguished from AF by the earliest negative P-peak deflection of the right atrium in the lead (aVR) and late positive left atrial deflection in lateral leads (I, aVL). Our results on lead-selection and feature-selection practices for AF detection should be considered for one- to twelve-lead ECG signal processing settings, particularly those measuring heart rate, AV conduction times, and P-/f-wave amplitudes. Performances are limited to the AF diagnostic potential of these three metrics. SHAP value importance can be used in combination with a human expert’s ECG interpretation to change the focus from a broad observation of 12-lead ECG morphology to focusing on the few AV synchronization findings strongly predictive of AF or non-AF arrhythmias. Our results are representative of AV synchronization findings across a broad taxonomy of cardiac arrhythmias in large 12-lead ECG databases.', 'Research of novel biosignal modalities with application to remote patient monitoring is a subject of state-of-the-art developments. This study is focused on sonified ECG modality, which can be transmitted as an acoustic wave and received by GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) microphones. Thus, the wireless connection between the patient module and the cloud server can be provided over an audio channel, such as a standard telephone call or audio message. Patients, especially the elderly or visually impaired, can benefit from ECG sonification because the wireless interface is readily available, facilitating the communication and transmission of secure ECG data from the patient monitoring device to the remote server. The aim of this study is to develop an AI-driven algorithm for 12-lead ECG sonification to support diagnostic reliability in the signal processing chain of the audio ECG stream. Our methods present the design of two algorithms: (1) a transformer (ECG-to-Audio) based on the frequency modulation (FM) of eight independent ECG leads in the very low frequency band (300–2700 Hz); and (2) a transformer (Audio-to-ECG) based on a four-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) to decode the audio ECG stream (10 s @ 11 kHz) to the original eight-lead ECG (10 s @ 250 Hz). The CNN model is trained in unsupervised regression mode, searching for the minimum error between the transformed and original ECG signals. The results are reported using the PTB-XL 12-lead ECG database (21,837 recordings), split 50:50 for training and test. The quality of FM-modulated ECG audio is monitored by short-time Fourier transform, and examples are illustrated in this paper and supplementary audio files. The errors of the reconstructed ECG are estimated by a popular ECG diagnostic toolbox. They are substantially low in all ECG leads: amplitude error (quartile range RMSE = 3–7 μV, PRD = 2–5.2%), QRS detector (Se, PPV > 99.7%), P-QRS-T fiducial points’ time deviation (<2 ms). Low errors generalized across diverse patients and arrhythmias are a testament to the efficacy of the developments. They support 12-lead ECG sonification as a wireless interface to provide reliable data for diagnostic measurements by automated tools or medical experts.']"

OS benefit with durvalumab plus EP versus EP was similar across PD-L1 subgroups, with HRs all falling within the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the PD-L1 BEP (0.47-0.79). OS benefit with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP was greater in PD-L1 ≥1% versus <1% subgroups, although CIs overlapped. There was no evidence of an interaction between tTMB and treatment effect on OS (durvalumab plus EP vs. EP, P = 0.916; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP vs. EP, P = 0.672).  OS benefit with first-line durvalumab plus EP in patients with ES-SCLC was observed regardless of PD-L1 or tTMB status.

MATERIAL AND 72 patients underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) following acute scaphoid fracture, and were followed prospectively by one surgeon. All fractures were Herbert & Fisher classification type B, the most common fracture lines being oblique (n=38) and transverse (n=34). Fractures with similar fracture lines were randomly assigned into two groups; fractures stabilized with one HBS (n=42) and fractures stabilized with two HBS (n=30). A specific methodology was developed for placement of two HBS; in the case of transverse fractures, screws were introduced perpendicular to the fracture line, for oblique fractures the first screw was placed perpendicular to the fracture line and the second screw was placed along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid. Patients were followed for a total 24 months, no patients were lost to follow-up. Outcome measures included bone healing, duration to bone healing, carpal geometry, range of motion (ROM), grip strength, and the Mayo Wrist Score. Patient rated outcomes were measured using DASH. Bone healing was radiographically and clinically confirmed in 70 patients. There were two non-unions after fixation with one HBS. Radiographic angles in both groups did not differ significantly from the physiological values. The mean duration to bone union was 1.8 months for one HBS and 1.5 months for two HBS. Mean grip strength was 47 kg in the group with one HBS (16-70 kg), 94 % of the unaffected hand, and 49 kg in the group with two HBS, 97% unaffected hand. The average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score for the group with one HBS was 2.5, while for the group with two HBS was 2.0. Both groups had excellent and good results. For the group with two HBS, they are more. (100% for those fixed with two HBS and for those fixed with one HBS = 95% excellent and good and 5% bad results). DISCUSSION A review of the literature confirms that the addition of the second screw increases the stability in the scaphoid fractures by offering added resistance to torque forces. Most authors propose the parallel placing of both screws in all cases. In our study we offer an algorithm for the placement of screws depending of the type of fracture line. For transverse fractures screws are placed parallel and perpendicular to the fracture line, for oblique fractures the first screw is placed perpendicular to the fracture line, and the second screw is placed along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid. This algorithm covers the main laboratory requirements for maximal fracture compression depending of the fracture line. This study of 72 patients in whom patients with similar fracture geometry were separated into two groups fixed by one HBS and fixed by two HBS. Analysis of the results demonstrate that osteosynthesis with two HBS creates greater fracture stability. The proposed algorithm for fixation of acute scaphoid fractures using two HBS is achieved by simultaneously placing the screw along the axial axis and perpendicular to the fracture line. The stability is improved by the equal distribution of the compression force on the entire fracture surface.', 'To investigate the biomechanical consequences of osteosynthesis of lateral hinge fractures (LHFs) in medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO).  Sixteen fresh-frozen human cadaveric proximal tibiae underwent MOWHTO fixed with an ipsilateral locking compression plate. The specimens were assigned to two clusters simulating LHFs according to the Takeuchi classification: (1) Type II fracture; and (2) Type III fracture. The following conditions were serially tested: (1) intact hinge; (2) fractured hinge; (3) screw fixation of the LHF; (4) staple fixation of the LHF; and (5) locking T-plate fixation of the LHF. Each specimen was subjected to 10 cycles of axial compression load (720 N; 36 N/s), and internal and external rotational loads (10 N m; 1 N m/s), while capturing the interfragmentary movements via motion tracking.  In Takeuchi Type II fractures, osteosynthesis of the fractured hinge with staples or a plate significantly reduced fracture site displacement (p < 0.05) and significantly increased construct stiffness (p < 0.05) under axial and torsional loading, while only the plate restored intact torsional displacement (n.s.). For Takeuchi Type III fractures, both screw and plate fixation significantly reduced fracture site displacement (p < 0.05) and significantly increased construct stiffness (p < 0.05) under axial and torsional loading. Both techniques restored torsional stiffness in each rotational direction and torsional displacement in internal rotation (n.s.).  Additional plate fixation of Takeuchi Type II fractures was the construct with the highest stiffness, restoring the axial and torsional stability to a MOWHTO with an intact hinge. Screw and plate fixation of Takeuchi Type III fractures provided equivalent stability and restored the torsional and axial stability of the MOWHTO. In case of a Takeuchi Type II or III fracture, surgeons should consider additional plate or screw osteosynthesis of the fractured hinge to best restore the stability of the MOWHTO, which may potentially reduce the risk of loss of correction and impaired bone healing. Level of Evidence: There is no level of evidence as this study was an experimental laboratory study.', 'Current literature lacks recommendations regarding proper fixation of tibial tubercle avulsion fractures involving the proximal tibial epiphysis (Ogden fractures). Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare isolated apophyseal screw fixation and additional fixation techniques in Ogden fractures.  Two different types of apoepiphyseal tibial tubercle avulsion fractures were created in 40 proximal tibiae according to the modified Ogden classification: (1) Ogden type IIIA and (2) Ogden type IV. The fractures were fixed with either isolated apophyseal screws or additionally with a medial plate or epiphyseal screws. All specimens were biomechanically tested under progressively increasing cyclic loading until failure, while capturing the interfragmentary movements with motion tracking.  Augmentation of apophyseal screw osteosynthesis by a medial plate in Ogden IV fractures or epiphyseal screws in Ogden IIIA fractures exhibited significantly higher cycles to failure and failure loads (P< 0.05), and significantly less axial displacement (P < 0.05) compared to isolated apophyseal screw fixation. Fixation of Ogden type IIIA fractures resulted in significantly less axial displacements and higher construct stiffness, cycles to failure and failure loads compared to Ogden type IV fracture (P < 0.001). Fracture gap opening did not differ significantly between the fixation techniques.  Augmented apophyseal screw fixation of apoepiphyseal tibial tubercle avulsion fractures provides greater biomechanical stability than isolated apophyseal screw fixation. Regardless of fixation technique, Ogden type IV fractures are more unstable than Ogden type IIIA fractures, so an individualized treatment strategy based on fracture morphology is crucial. In case of an Ogden type IIIA or Ogden type IV fracture, surgeons should consider adding epiphyseal screws or a medial plate osteosynthesis to apophyseal screw fixation to best neutralize forces of the extensor mechanism, as long as the often compromised soft tissue envelope can tolerate greater surgical invasiveness.']"

A questionnaire survey was distributed among the medical students of Medical University – Sofia, included 640 students in 4, 5 and 6 years of their study. It analyses the necessity of learning the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, approved on the 19th of October 2005 by the UNESCO General Assembly.  About ½ of the participants in the empirical study, to varying degrees, were not familiar with the bioethical principles of UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. A large proportion of respondents gave affirmative responses about the importance of ethical knowledge in their future medical practice. According to the respondents, training in Bioethics and Human Rights will increase their ethical competence as medical professionals.

The aim of this study was to gain an insight into the problems concerning patient safety culture, based on the analysis of data, collected after interviewing healthcare specialists working in surgical and nonsurgical units in selected Bulgarian hospitals. This was a cross-sectional online study using a web-platform and the Bulgarian Version of Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. It was conducted among healthcare workers (n = 620) in 2021. The B-HSOPSC incudes 42 scales grouped in 12 different domains. We compared the percentage of positive ratings and outcome dimensions between surgical and other hospital departments with the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test, χ2 tests, Fisher’s Exact Test, and OR. The results showed that there are no statistically significant differences between the ratings on Patient Safety Culture given by the surgical and the nonsurgical staff except for the dimension “Hospital management support for patient safety”. from the study highlighted that the most important aspect of hospital patient safety is the shortage of medical staff in both surgical and nonsurgical hospital units. Communication, work shift organization, handoffs and transitions between shifts and among different hospital units, as well as communication with line managers were rated as satisfactory in Bulgarian hospitals.', 'and aims. Patient safety culture (PSC) is an essential component of the quality of healthcare. Improving PSC is considered a priority in many developed countries. A specialized software platform for registration and evaluation of hospital patient safety culture has been developed with the support of the Medical University Plovdiv Project No11/2017. The aim of the study is to assess the status of PSC in Bulgarian hospitals and to compare it to that in USA and Croatian hospitals.  The study was conducted from June 01 to July 31, 2018 using the web-based Bulgarian Version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture Questionnaire (B-HSOPSC). Two hundred and forty-eight medical professionals from different hospitals in Bulgaria participated in the study. In order to quantify the differences of positive scores distributions for each of the 42 HSOPSC items between Bulgarian, Croatian and USA samples, the χ2-test was applied. The research hypothesis assumed that there were no significant differences between the Bulgarian, Croatian and US PSCs.  The results revealed 14 significant differences in the positive scores between the Bulgarian and Croatian PSCs and 15 between the Bulgarian and the USA PSC, respectively. Bulgarian medical professionals provided less positive responses to 12 items compared with Croatian and USA respondents. The Bulgarian respondents were more positive compared to Croatians on the feedback and communication of medical errors (Items - C1, C4, C5) as well as on the employment of locum staff (A7) and the frequency of reported mistakes (D1). Bulgarian medical professionals were more positive compared with their USA colleagues on the communication of information at shift handover and across hospital units (F5, F7). The distribution of positive scores on items: ""Staff worry that their mistakes are kept in their personnel file"" (RA16), ""Things \'fall between the cracks\' when transferring patients from one unit to another"" (RF3) and ""Shift handovers are problematic for patients in this hospital"" (RF11) were significantly higher among Bulgarian respondents compared with Croatian and US respondents.  Significant differences of positive scores distribution were found between Bulgarian and USA PSC on one hand and between Bulgarian and Croatian on the other. The study reveals that distribution of positive responses could be explained by the cultural, organizational and healthcare system differences.']"

Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).  We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE difered from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings: The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years (1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2·3% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs ofset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the fve lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. Interpretation: At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs ofset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention eforts, and development assistance for health, including fnancial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support.', 'In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.  GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution. Findings: Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI. Interpretation: As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.', ""The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 provides a comprehensive assessment of health and risk factor trends at global, regional, national, and subnational levels. This study aims to examine the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the USA and highlight the disparities in health outcomes across different states.  GBD 2021 analysed trends in mortality, morbidity, and disability for 371 diseases and injuries and 88 risk factors in the USA between 1990 and 2021. We used several metrics to report sources of health and health loss related to specific diseases, injuries, and risk factors. GBD 2021 methods accounted for differences in data sources and biases. The analysis of levels and trends for causes and risk factors within the same computational framework enabled comparisons across states, years, age groups, and sex. GBD 2021 estimated years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost to premature mortality and YLDs) for 371 diseases and injuries, years of life lost (YLLs) and mortality for 288 causes of death, and life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We provided estimates for 88 risk factors in relation to 155 health outcomes for 631 risk–outcome pairs and produced risk-specific estimates of summary exposure value, relative health risk, population attributable fraction, and risk-attributable burden measured in DALYs and deaths. Estimates were produced by sex (male and female), age (25 age groups from birth to ≥95 years), and year (annually between 1990 and 2021). 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles values of 500 draws (ie, 500 random samples from the estimate's distribution). Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the estimation process. Findings: We found disparities in health outcomes and risk factors across US states. Our analysis of GBD 2021 highlighted the relative decline in life expectancy and HALE compared with other countries, as well as the impact of COVID-19 during the first 2 years of the pandemic. We found a decline in the USA's ranking of life expectancy from 1990 to 2021: in 1990, the USA ranked 35th of 204 countries and territories for males and 19th for females, but dropped to 46th for males and 47th for females in 2021. When comparing life expectancy in the best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other countries and territories (excluding the USA as a whole), Hawaii (the best-ranked state in 1990 and 2021) dropped from sixth-highest life expectancy in the world for males and fourth for females in 1990 to 28th for males and 22nd for females in 2021. The worst-ranked state in 2021 ranked 107th for males (Mississippi) and 99th for females (West Virginia). 14 US states lost life expectancy over the study period, with West Virginia experiencing the greatest loss (2·7 years between 1990 and 2021). HALE ranking declines were even greater; in 1990, the USA was ranked 42nd for males and 32nd for females but dropped to 69th for males and 76th for females in 2021. When comparing HALE in the best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other countries and territories, Hawaii ranked 14th highest HALE for males and fifth for females in 1990, dropping to 39th for males and 34th for females in 2021. In 2021, West Virginia—the lowest-ranked state that year—ranked 141st for males and 137th for females. Nationally, age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2021 for many leading causes of death, most notably for ischaemic heart disease (56·1% [95% UI 55·1–57·2] decline), lung cancer (41·9% [39·7–44·6]), and breast cancer (40·9% [38·7–43·7]). Over the same period, age-standardised mortality rates increased for other causes, particularly drug use disorders (878·0% [770·1–1015·5]), chronic kidney disease (158·3% [149·6–167·9]), and falls (89·7% [79·8–95·8]). We found substantial variation in mortality rates between states, with Hawaii having the lowest age-standardised mortality rate (433·2 per 100 000 [380·6–493·4]) in 2021 and Mississippi having the highest (867·5 per 100 000 [772·6–975·7]). Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised mortality rates throughout the study period, whereas Washington, DC, experienced the most improvement (a 40·7% decline [33·2–47·3]). Only six countries had age-standardised rates of YLDs higher than the USA in 2021: Afghanistan, Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, South Africa, and the Central African Republic, largely because the impact of musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, and substance use disorders on age-standardised disability rates in the USA is so large. At the state level, eight US states had higher age-standardised YLD rates than any country in the world: West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arizona. Low back pain was the leading cause of YLDs in the USA in 1990 and 2021, although the age-standardised rate declined by 7·9% (1·8–13·0) from 1990. Depressive disorders (56·0% increase [48·2–64·3]) and drug use disorders (287·6% [247·9–329·8]) were the second-leading and third-leading causes of age-standardised YLDs in 2021. For females, mental health disorders had the highest age-standardised YLD rate, with an increase of 59·8% (50·6–68·5) between 1990 and 2021. Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised rates of YLDs for all sexes combined (12 085·3 per 100 000 [9090·8–15 557·1]), whereas West Virginia had the highest (14 832·9 per 100 000 [11 226·9–18 882·5]). At the national level, the leading GBD Level 2 risk factors for death for all sexes combined in 2021 were high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, and tobacco use. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardised mortality rates attributable to high systolic blood pressure decreased by 47·8% (43·4–52·5) and for tobacco use by 5·1% (48·3%–54·1%), but rates increased for high fasting plasma glucose by 9·3% (0·4–18·7). The burden attributable to risk factors varied by age and sex. For example, for ages 15–49 years, the leading risk factors for death were drug use, high alcohol use, and dietary risks. By comparison, for ages 50–69 years, tobacco was the leading risk factor for death, followed by dietary risks and high BMI. Interpretation: GBD 2021 provides valuable information for policy makers, health-care professionals, and researchers in the USA at the national and state levels to prioritise interventions, allocate resources effectively, and assess the effects of health policies and programmes. By addressing socioeconomic determinants, risk behaviours, environmental influences, and health disparities among minority populations, the USA can work towards improving health outcomes so that people can live longer and healthier lives.""]"

Both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep have been implicated with oﬄine re-activation and reorganization of memories supporting explicit knowledge generation. According to two-stage models of sleep function, oﬄine processing of information during sleep is sequential requiring multiple cycles of NREM and REM sleep stages. However, the role of overnight dynamic sleep macrostructure for insightfulness has not been studied so far. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that the frequency of interactions between NREM and REM sleep stages might be critical for awareness after sleep. For that aim, the rate of sleep stage transitions was evaluated in 53 participants who learned implicitly a serial reaction time task (SRTT) in which a determined sequence was inserted. The amount of explicit knowledge about the sequence was established by verbal recall after a night of sleep following SRTT learning. Polysomnography was recorded in this night and in a control night before and was analyzed to compare the rate of sleep-stage transitions between participants who did or did not gain awareness of task regularity after sleep. Indeed, individual ability of explicit knowledge generation was strongly associated with increased rate of transitions between NREM and REM sleep stages and between light sleep stages and slow wave sleep. However, the rate of NREM–REM transitions specifically predicted the amount of explicit knowledge after sleep in a trait-dependent way. These results demonstrate that enhanced lability of sleep goes along with individual ability of knowledge awareness. Observations suggest that facilitated dynamic interactions between sleep stages, particularly between NREM and REM sleep stages play a role for oﬄine processing which promotes rule extraction and awareness.', 'Solving a task with insight has been associated with occipital and right-hemisphere activations. The present study tested the hypothesis if sleep-related alterations in functional activation states modulate the probability of insight into a hidden abstract regularity of a task. Methodology: State-dependent functional activation was measured by beta and alpha electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and spatial synchronization. Task-dependent functional activation was assessed by slow cortical potentials (SPs). EEG parameters during the performance of the Number Reduction Task (NRT) were compared between before sleep and after sleep sessions. In two different groups, the relevant sleep occurred either in the first or in the second half of the night, dominated by slow wave sleep (SWS) or by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Principal Findings: Changes in EEG parameters only occurred in the early-night group, not in the late-night group and indicated occipital and right-hemisphere functional alterations. These changes were associated with off-line consolidation of implicit task representations and with the amount of SWS but they did not predict subsequent insight. The gain of insight was, however, independently associated with changes of spectral beta and alpha measures only in those subjects from the two sleep groups who would subsequently comprehend the hidden regularity of the task. Insight-related enhancement of right frontal asymmetry after sleep did not depend on sleep stages. Significance:It is concluded that off-line restructuring of implicit information during sleep is accompanied by alterations of functional activation states after sleep. This mechanism is promoted by SWS but not by REM sleep and may contribute to attaining insight after sleep. Original neurophysiologic evidence is provided for alterations of the functional activation brain states after sleep. These alterations are associated with a decrease in controlled processing within the visual system and with an increase in the functional connectivity of the right hemisphere, and are supported by SWS in the first half of the night.', 'The present study assessed the effects of awareness at encoding on off-line learning during sleep. A new framework is suggested according to which two aspects of awareness are distinguished: awareness of task information, and awareness of task processing. The number reduction task (NRT) was employed because it has two levels of organization, an overt one based on explicit knowledge of task instructions, and a covert one based on hidden abstract regularities of task structure (implicit knowledge). Each level can be processed consciously (explicitly) or non-consciously (implicitly). Different performance parameters were defined to evaluate changes between two sessions for each of the four conditions of awareness arising from whether explicit or implicit task information was processed explicitly or implicitly. In two groups of subjects, the interval between the pre-sleep and post-sleep sessions was filled either with early-night sleep, rich in slow wave sleep (SWS), or late-night sleep, rich in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. show that implicit processing of explicit information was improved in the post-sleep relative to the pre-sleep session only in the early-night group. Independently of sleep stage, changes between sessions occurred for explicit processing of implicit information only in those subjects who gained insight into the task regularity after sleep. It is concluded that SWS but not REM sleep specifically supports gains in computational skills for the processing of information that was accessible by consciousness before sleep.']"

Effective educational initiatives are informed by studies of dementia knowledge. However, most of these studies are conducted in high-income countries, leaving the Balkan region underrepresented. This study aimed to conduct the first investigation of dementia knowledge among the Bulgarian population, exploring recognition of symptoms, general dementia knowledge, and risk factors awareness.  Using an online survey we assessed the following components of knowledge: (i) recognition of dementia symptoms from a vignette; (ii) dementia literacy measured with the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS); and (iii) knowledge about dementia risk factors. Demographic characteristics, previous experience with dementia, and patterns of informing about dementia were also considered in the study.  One thousand, eight hundred and ninety-six adults (mean age = 44.99; 51.79% female) completed the survey. Half of the respondents correctly recognised dementia symptoms from a vignette. The average DKAS score was 9.51. Dementia knowledge was linked to education, marital status, employment, ethnicity, experience with dementia, and informational sources. 56.7% of the respondents thought dementia was a normal part of ageing and 74.8% did not know a healthy lifestyle reduces the risk of dementia. The average number of identified risk factors was eight (out of 17), with many mistakenly citing dental fillings, laziness, and witchcraft as contributors to dementia.  The Bulgarian society has a poor understanding of dementia, highlighting the need for improved awareness and education. Policy-makers should prioritise dementia as a social issue and take coordinated actions to educate society and eradicate harmful misconceptions.', 'There are few longitudinal studies with controversial results examining delayed changes in cognition after ischemic stroke and predictive values of neuropsychological and neuroimaging markers.  The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delayed changes in cognition in poststroke patients and their relationship to the neuropsychological and neuroimaging markers measured during the acute poststroke phase.  Eighty-five first-ever stroke inpatients (mean age 65.6±5.6 years) without previous cognitive complaints were prospectively evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at the 5th day and the 1st, 6th, and 12th months. A wide range of clinical, radiological, and neuropsychological variables were examined.  Our results showed significantly poorer performance on mini–mental state examination, memory, attention/executive functions, and processing speed in patients with stroke in comparison with stroke-free cognitively intact controls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that hippocampal atrophy is the strongest predictor of delayed cognitive impairment. Secondary divided subgroups according to Isaacs Set Test (IST) score showed that patients with IST score ≤28 had different patterns of cognitive and neurological impairment after 1 year. Baseline impairments in attention/executive functions and memory were associated with development of dementia in poststroke patients.  Executive functioning deficit appears to have a predictive power for cognitive impairment progression. The study suggests that IST as a screening test has a potential to be a reliable and quick tool for poststroke cognitive impairment evaluation and delayed cognitive and neurological outcome. Hippocampal atrophy was the strongest predictor for cognitive impairment outcome, even in poststroke cognitive impairment. The findings may set the stage for better poststroke management.']"

Nevertheless, given the well-established relationship between higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and plaque burden, as well as greater risk reductions seen with PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with baseline LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on statin therapy, the efficacy of CSL112 may be influenced by baseline LDL-C.  Overall, 18 219 patients with acute MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and additional risk factors were randomized to either four weekly infusions of 6 g CSL112 or placebo. This exploratory post-hoc analysis evaluated cardiovascular outcomes by baseline LDL-C in patients prescribed guideline-directed statin therapy at the time of randomization (n = 15 731).  As baseline LDL-C increased, the risk of the primary endpoint at 90 days lowered in those treated with CSL112 compared with placebo. In patients with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL at randomization, there was a significant risk reduction of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in the CSL112 vs. placebo group at 90, 180, and 365 days [hazard ratio. 69 (.53-.90),. 71 (.57-.88), and. 78 (.65-.93)]. In contrast, there was no difference between treatment groups among those with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL at baseline.  In this population, treatment with CSL112 compared to placebo was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with a baseline LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL. Further studies need to confirm that CSL112 efficacy is influenced by baseline LDL-C.', 'Patients who have had an acute coronary syndrome are at high risk for recurrent ischemic cardiovascular events. We sought to determine whether alirocumab, a human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), would improve cardiovascular outcomes after an acute coronary syndrome in patients receiving high-intensity statin therapy. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 18,924 patients who had an acute coronary syndrome 1 to 12 months earlier, had a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of at least 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter), a non-highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter), or an apolipoprotein B level of at least 80 mg per deciliter, and were receiving statin therapy at a high-intensity dose or at the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alirocumab subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg (9462 patients) or matching placebo (9462 patients) every 2 weeks. The dose of alirocumab was adjusted under blinded conditions to target an LDL cholesterol level of 25 to 50 mg per deciliter (0.6 to 1.3 mmol per liter). The primary end point was a composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. The median duration of follow-up was 2.8 years. A composite primary end-point event occurred in 903 patients (9.5%) in the alirocumab group and in 1052 patients (11.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.93; P<0.001). A total of 334 patients (3.5%) in the alirocumab group and 392 patients (4.1%) in the placebo group died (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98). The absolute benefit of alirocumab with respect to the composite primary end point was greater among patients who had a baseline LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg or more per deciliter than among patients who had a lower baseline level. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups, with the exception of local injection-site reactions (3.8% in the alirocumab group vs. 2.1% in the placebo group). Among patients who had a previous acute coronary syndrome and who were receiving highintensity statin therapy, the risk of recurrent ischemic cardiovascular events was lower among those who received alirocumab than among those who received placebo.', 'High triglyceride levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but whether reductions in these levels would lower the incidence of cardiovascular events is uncertain. Pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator, reduces triglyceride levels and improves other lipid levels. In a multinational, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level, 200 to 499 mg per deciliter), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels of 40 mg per deciliter or lower to receive pemafibrate (0.2-mg tablets twice daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients were receiving guideline-directed lipid-lowering therapy or could not receive statin therapy without adverse effects and had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 100 mg per deciliter or lower. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, or death from cardiovascular causes. Among 10,497 patients (66.9% with previous cardiovascular disease), the median baseline fasting triglyceride level was 271 mg per deciliter, HDL cholesterol level 33 mg per deciliter, and LDL cholesterol level 78 mg per deciliter. The median follow-up was 3.4 years. As compared with placebo, the effects of pemafibrate on lipid levels at 4 months were -26.2% for triglycerides, -25.8% for very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, -25.6% for remnant cholesterol (cholesterol transported in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins after lipolysis and lipoprotein remodeling), -27.6% for apolipoprotein C-III, and 4.8% for apolipoprotein B. A primary end-point event occurred in 572 patients in the pemafibrate group and in 560 of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.15), with no apparent effect modification in any prespecified subgroup. The overall incidence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups, but pemafibrate was associated with a higher incidence of adverse renal events and venous thromboembolism and a lower incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, the incidence of cardiovascular events was not lower among those who received pemafibrate than among those who received placebo, although pemafibrate lowered triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, and apolipoprotein C-III levels.

The final analysis included the records of 80 children with newly diagnosed IBD: 45 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 35 with Crohn’s disease (CD). The prevalence of anemia was 60.0% in the UC patients and 77.1% in the CD patients. Of the UC patients with anemia, 37.1% had pancolitis, 18.5% extensive disease, 33.3% left-sided colitis and 11.1% ulcerative proctitis. Of the CD patients with anemia, 81.5% had ileocolonic disease, 11.1% colonic disease and 7.4% ileal disease. Anemia was less common in patients with mild disease than in patients with moderate–severe disease (22.2 vs. 77.8%, p < 0.001 in UC and 25.9% vs. 74.1%, p < 0.001 in CD).

Fifty-eight patients with active IBD (32 with CD and 26 with UC) and 25 healthy controls consented to participate in the study. The clinical activity of CD was estimated using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and the endoscopic activity of UC using the Mayo scoring system. IP was assessed by the rise in levels of iohexol, which was administered orally (25 mL, 350 mg/mL) 2 h after breakfast. Three and six hours later serum (SIC mg/L) and urine (UIC g/mol) iohexol concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC-UV technique.  In the CD group, SIC values at 3 h (2.95 ± 2.11 mg/L) and at 6 h after ingestion (2.63 ± 2.18 mg/L) were significantly higher compared to those of healthy subjects (1.25 ± 1.40 mg/L and 1.11 ± 1.10 mg/L, respectively, P < 0.05). UIC (g/mol) values were also higher in patients, but the differences were significant only for UIC at 6 h. Significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) was found between the CDAI and IP, assessed by SIC at 3 h (r = 0.60) and 6 h (r = 0.74) after the ingestion. In comparison to controls, SIC and UIC of UC patients were higher in the two studied periods, but the differences were significant at 6 h only. Significantly higher values of SIC (P < 0.05) were found in patients with severe endoscopic activity of UC compared to those of patients with mild and moderate activity (3.68 ± 3.18 vs 0.92 ± 0.69 mg/L).  Serum levels of iohexol at 3 h and 6 h after its ingestion reflect increased I P, which is related to the disease activity in patients with IBD."", ""Endoscopic evaluation is the gold standard for monitoring the disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but the procedure is invasive and not appropriate for frequent use, especially in the paediatric population.

Materials and methods: A single center study including 31 children with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 22 children with Crohn's disease (CD) with different disease duration and activity. All participants provided blood samples to measure the levels of white blood cell count, platelets, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin and fibrinogen, and faecal samples for measurement of faecal calprotectin and faecal alpha-1 antitrypsin. All participants underwent endoscopic evaluation. Endoscopic disease activity was assessed according to the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease in UC and CD patients, respectively.  135 visits were included: 73 for UC patients and 62 for CD patients. In UC patients the strongest correlation was between the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore and the faecal calprotectin ( r =0.867, p <0.001) followed by the albumin ( r =0.523, p <0.001) and the C-reactive protein ( r =0.487, p <0.001). In CD the strongest correlation was between the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease and the faecal calprotectin ( r =0.872, p <0.001) followed by the C-reactive protein (0.708, p <0.001) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (0.605, p <0.001).

The SWIFT (“Studies with von Willebrand factor/Factor VIII”) program is evaluating pdVWF/FVIII in patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD). The long-term efficacy and safety profile of pdVWF/FVIII was investigated in this multicenter, open-label, extension study.  Pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with VWD who required treatment of non-surgical bleeds (NSBs), treatment during surgical events or who were receiving prophylaxis and who had completed one of two previous clinical trials of pdVWF/FVIII were included. Efficacy and safety analyses were performed for on-demand (n=10), prophylaxis (n=8), or on-demand and prophylaxis (n=2) treatment in patients pre-treated with pdVWF/FVIII for ≥12 months.  Seven patients ex®erienced a total of 402 NSBs in the on-demand arm, of which 77 required treatment and nine NSB events in three patients were considered major. Nine patients reported 118 NSBs in the prophylaxis arm, with 96 events requiring treatment and seven patients experiencing 12 major NSB events. Excellent or good hemostatic efficacy was reported by the investigator for 98.7% (on-demand) and 97.9% (prophylaxis) of NSB events treated with pdVWF/FVIII, without relevant differences between subgroups by age. pdVWF/FVIII was well tolerated, and the adverse events seen were mild-moderate and consistent with the safety profile for this product seen in other studies. There were no cases of anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, development of VWF/FVIII inhibitors, thromboembolic events, or viral infections.  This contemporary comprehensive development program evaluating pdVWF/FVIII across all ages demonstrates long-term safety and efficacy for treatment and prevention of bleeds in patients with severe VWD, supporting the benefit–risk profile of pdVWF/FVIII.', 'Efanesoctocog alfa (rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN; BIVV001) is a new class of factor VIII (FVIII) replacement that breaks the von Willebrand factor–imposed FVIII half-life ceiling.

Participating physicians recruited> 29,000 hypertensive patients whom they considered to be candidates (according to specified criteria) for treatment with eprosartan 600 mg/day, with other drugs added at the discretion of the physician.  During treatment, systolic blood pressure decreased by 25.8 ± 14.4 mmHg to 134.6 ± 11.4 mmHg (P < 0.001), mean diastolic blood pressure fell by 12.6 ± 9.5 mmHg to 81.1 ± 7.6 mmHg, and pulse pressure fell by 13.2 ± 13.5 mmHg to 53.6 ± 11.4 mmHg (both P < 0.01). Calculated total cardiovascular risk declined in parallel with the reduction in blood pressure.  The POWER study has demonstrated, in a large and nonselected population, the feasibility and practicability of reducing total cardiovascular risk through systematic management of high blood pressure."", 'Hypertension can be detected at the primary health-care level and low-cost treatments can effectively control hypertension. We aimed to measure the prevalence of hypertension and progress in its detection, treatment, and control from 1990 to 2019 for 200 countries and territories.  We used data from 1990 to 2019 on people aged 30–79 years from population-representative studies with measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age. Findings: The number of people aged 30–79 years with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95% credible interval 306–359) million women and 317 (292–344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584–668) million women and 652 (604–698) million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019, age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe including Switzerland, Spain, and the UK for women; and in several low-income and middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50% for women in two countries and men in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Globally, 59% (55–62) of women and 49% (46–52) of men with hypertension reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47% (43–51) of women and 38% (35–41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension in 2019 were 23% (20–27) for women and 18% (16–21) for men. In 2019, treatment and control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment >70%; control >50%), followed by the USA, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment rates were less than 25% for women and less than 20% for men in Nepal, Indonesia, and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10% for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa, central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran. Interpretation: Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.', 'Arterial hypertension is the most common correctable risk factor for death worldwide. Achievement of therapeutic goal is hampered by multiple factors including non-adherence to drug therapy and individual physiological resistance.  We aimed to determine the efficacy of renal denervation in lowering SBP and DBP at 1st and 6th month, in patients at high cardiovascular risk, in whom lowering BP would possibly also result in risk reduction and lower incidence of future cardiovascular events.  The procedure was performed in 39 patients with resistant hypertension admitted to the University Hospital „Acibadem City Clinic – Cardiovascular Center“ (Sofia) for the period January 2017–June 2020. Access was via brachial artery and the Simplicity Spiral catheters were used, at an average of 19.5 ablation points per artery. The number of complications, as well as the mean systolic and diastolic BP values at 1st and 6th month were recorded. Baseline, risk profile and follow-up medical treatment of the study group was monitored.  In the study group, the predominant risk factors were dyslipidemia, age, diabetes mellitus, with 21 patients (53.84%) already having clinically significant atherosclerosis – a realized heart attack, stroke, peripheral or coronary revascularization. At follow-up, a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP (blood pressure) values was observed. At the first month, the fall in SBP (systolic blood pressure) was –17.8 mm Hg, with a persistent reduction in the range of –14.5 mm Hg at 6th month. In terms of DBP (diastolic BP), the mean reduction at the first month was –8.9 mm Hg and at the 6th month it was –7.2 mm Hg. Regarding antihypertensive treatment, there was a mild reduction in the intake of antihypertensive drugs.  Substantial proportion of people with hypertension have uncontrolled hypertension (both treatment resistant and due to non-adherence to treatment or due to additional pathophysiological mechanisms). Renal denervation has proven effective and safe in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and high cardiovascular risk profile.']"

The obtained derivatives of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and 5-methoxy-indole carboxylic acid (5MICA) had good safety profiles: Hemolytic effects < 5% (200 μM) and IC50 > 150 µM were found in the majority of the SH-SY5Y and bEnd3 cell lines. The 2,3-dihydroxy, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy, and syringaldehyde derivatives of 5MICA exhibited the strongest neuroprotection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells and 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in rat-brain synaptosomes. All the compounds suppressed the iron-induced lipid peroxidation. The hydroxyl derivatives were also the most active in terms of deoxyribose-degradation inhibition, whereas the 3,4-dihydroxy derivatives were able to decrease the superoxide-anion generation. Both series of compounds showed an increased inhibition of hMAO-B, with greater expression detected in the 5MICA hybrids. The in vitro BBB model with the bEnd3 cell line showed that some compounds increased the permeability of the endothelial monolayer while maintaining the tight junctions. The combined results demonstrated that the derivatives of IPA and 5MICA showed strong neuroprotective, antioxidant, MAO-B inhibitory activity and could be considered as prospective multifunctional compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.', 'Oxidative stress is a key contributing factor in the complex degenerating cascade in Par-kinson’s disease. The inhibition of MAO‐B affords higher dopamine bioavailability and stops ROS formation. The incorporation of hydroxy and methoxy groups in the arylhydrazone moiety of a new series of 1,3‐disubstituted benzimidazole‐2‐thiones could increase the neuroprotective activity. In vitro safety evaluation on SH‐SY5Y cells and rat brain synaptosomes showed a strong safety profile. Antioxidant and neuroprotective effects were evaluated in H2O2‐induced oxidative stress on SH‐ SY5Y cells and in a model of 6‐OHDA‐induced neurotoxicity in rat brain synaptosomes, where the dihydroxy compounds 3h and 3i demonstrated the most robust neuroprotective and antioxidant activity, more pronounced than the reference melatonin and rasagiline. Statistically significant MAO‐B inhibitory effects were exerted by some of the compounds where again the catecholic compound 3h was the most potent inhibitor similar to selegiline and rasagiline. The most potent anti-oxidant effect in the ferrous iron induced lipid peroxidation assay was observed for the three cate-chols—3h and 3j, 3q. The catecholic compound 3h showed scavenging capability against superox-ide radicals and antioxidant effect in the iron/deoxyribose system. The study outlines a perspective multifunctional compound with the best safety profile, neuroprotective, antioxidant and MAO‐B inhibiting properties.', ""Neuroprotective drugs and selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors can slow down the progression and improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Since there is an implication of oxidative stress in the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, the compounds possessing an ability to reduce the oxidative stress are prime candidates for neuroprotection. Thereby our current study is focused on the development of new multi-target PD drugs capable of inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase-B while exerting neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. A small series of benzimidazole derivatives containing hydroxy and methoxy arylhydrazone fragments has been synthesized and the neurotoxicity of the compounds has been evaluated in vitro on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and on isolated rat brain synaptosomes by measuring the cell viability and the levels of reduced glutathione and a good safety profile has been shown. The 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy substituted arylhydrazone 7 was the least toxic on neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and showed the lowest neurotoxicity in rat brain synaptosomes. The neuroprotective properties of the test compounds were further assessed using two models: H2O2-induced oxidative stress on SH-SY5Y cells and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity in rat brain synaptosomes. Compound 7 showed more pronounced neuroprotective activity on SH-SY5Y cells, compared to the referent melatonin and rasagiline. It also preserved the synaptosomal viability and the reduced glutathione levels; the effects were stronger than those of rasagiline and comparable to melatonin. All the tested compounds were capable to inhibit human monoamine oxidase-B enzyme to a significant extent, however, compound 7 exerted the most prominent inhibitory activity, similar to selegiline and rasagiline. The carried out molecular docking studies revealed that the activity is related to the appropriate molecular structure enabling the ligand to enter deeper in the narrow and highly lipophylic active site pocket of the human monoamine oxidase-B and has a favoring interaction with the key amino acid residues Tyr326 and Cys172. Since much scientific evidence points out the implication of iron dyshomeostasis in PD, the compounds were tested to reduce the ferrous iron induced oxidative molecular damage on biologically important molecules in an in vitro lecithin containing model system. All the investigated compounds denoted protection effect, stronger than the one of the referent melatonin. In order to support the assignments of the significant neuroprotective and antioxidant pharmacological activities, the radical-scavenging mechanisms of the most promising compound 7 were evaluated using DFT methods. It was found that the most probable free radicals scavenging mechanism in nonpolar phase is the hydrogen atom transfer from the amide group of compound 7, while in polar medium the process is expected to occur by a proton transfer. The current study outlines a perspective leading structure, bearing the potential for a new anti-PD drug.

Interoperability of resources is achieved using a common information model, based on the OpenTox ontologies, describing predictive algorithms, models and toxicity data. As toxicological data may come from different, heterogeneous sources, a deployed ontology, unifying the terminology and the resources, is critical for the rational and reliable organization of the data, and its automatic processing.  The following related ontologies have been developed for OpenTox: a) Toxicological ontology - listing the toxicological endpoints; b) Organs system and Effects ontology - addressing organs, targets/examinations and effects observed in in vivo studies; c) ToxML ontology - representing semi-automatic conversion of the ToxML schema; d) OpenTox ontology- representation of OpenTox framework components: chemical compounds, datasets, types of algorithms, models and validation web services; e) ToxLink-ToxCast assays ontology and f) OpenToxipedia community knowledge resource on toxicology terminology. OpenTox components are made available through standardized REST web services, where every compound, data set, and predictive method has a unique resolvable address (URI), used to retrieve its Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation, or to initiate the associated calculations and generate new RDF-based resources. The services support the integration of toxicity and chemical data from various sources, the generation and validation of computer models for toxic effects, seamless integration of new algorithms and scientifically sound validation routines and provide a flexible framework, which allows building arbitrary number of applications, tailored to solving different problems by end users (e.g. toxicologists).

In this article we review ontology developments based on a set of perspectives showing how ontologies are being used in predictive toxicology initiatives and applications. Perspectives on resources and initiatives reviewed include OpenTox, eTOX, Pistoia Alliance, ToxWiz, Virtual Liver, EU-ADR, BEL, ToxML, and Bioclipse. We also review existing ontology developments in neighboring fields that can contribute to establishing an ontological framework for predictive toxicology. A significant set of resources is already available to provide a foundation for an ontological framework for 21st century mechanistic-based toxicology research. Ontologies such as ToxWiz provide a basis for application to toxicology investigations, whereas other ontologies under development in the biological, chemical, and biomedical communities could be incorporated in an extended future framework. OpenTox has provided a semantic web framework for the implementation of such ontologies into software applications and linked data resources. Bioclipse developers have shown the benefit of interoperability obtained through ontology by being able to link their workbench application with remote OpenTox web services. Although these developments are promising, an increased international coordination of efforts is greatly needed to develop a more unified, standardized, and open toxicology ontology framework.', ""Foreign substances can have a dramatic and unpredictable adverse effect on human health. In the development of new therapeutic agents, it is essential that the potential adverse effects of all candidates be identified as early as possible. The field of predictive toxicology strives to profile the potential for adverse effects of novel chemical substances before they occur, both with traditional in vivo experimental approaches and increasingly through the development of in vitro and computational methods which can supplement and reduce the need for animal testing. To be maximally effective, the field needs access to the largest possible knowledge base of previous toxicology findings, and such results need to be made available in such a fashion so as to be interoperable, comparable, and compatible with standard toolkits. This necessitates the development of open, public, computable, and standardized toxicology vocabularies and ontologies so as to support the applications required by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo toxicology methods and related analysis and reporting activities. Such ontology development will support data management, model building, integrated analysis, validation and reporting, including regulatory reporting and alternative testing submission requirements as required by guidelines such as the REACH legislation, leading to new scientific advances in a mechanistically-based predictive toxicology. Numerous existing ontology and standards initiatives can contribute to the creation of a toxicology ontology supporting the needs of predictive toxicology and risk assessment. Additionally, new ontologies are needed to satisfy practical use cases and scenarios where gaps currently exist. Developing and integrating these resources will require a well-coordinated and sustained effort across numerous stakeholders engaged in a public-private partnership. In this communication, we set out a roadmap for the development of an integrated toxicology ontology, harnessing existing resources where applicable.

Materials and methods A monocentric, retrospective study was conducted, using the data of 70 female patients, who visited the endocrinology department of the “Dr. Shterev” Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria between May 2020 and September 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of vitamin D3 supplementation: either a microencapsulated liposomal form (n=35), or a conventional oil-based form (n=35). The following clinical measures were analysed and compared: BMI, serum levels of 25(OH)D, fasting plasma glucose levels, fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, levels of antimullerian hormone (AMH) II generation, and testosterone. In all selected patients, these measurements were performed at baseline and 3 months after initiation of vitamin D supplementation. results Significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH) D were observed in patients supplemented with the microencapsulated form of vitamin D3 in the third month from the beginning of therapy, compared with the control group (p=0.003).

The fasting plasma glucose levels did not change significantly. The results of our study show that the patients supplemented with a microencapsulated form of vitamin D3 achieved faster compensation of 25(OH) D levels, which in turn, under equal conditions, led to significant improvement in the metabolic profile, in particular insulin sensitivity.', 'Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread problem throughout the world, often resulting from impaired synthesis in the skin and insufficient intake. The present study aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of vitamin D intake in individuals who are normal weight, overweight, and obese in relation to plasma vitamin D levels in these individuals. Materials and methods: There were 264 participants in the study. Nutrition was evaluated using the 24-hour memory recall approach. Weight and body composition were determined by expert bio-electrical impedance using Tanita equipment (420 BC MA), while nutritional status was evaluated using anthropometric indicators, including morphological indicators and anthropometric indices.  The average daily intake of vitamin D was determined to be 7.6 μg for normal-weight participants, 6.6 μg for individuals who are overweight, and 6.0 μg for subjects who are obese, based on BMI categories. When comparing people who consumed more than 10 μg of vitamin D, the group with adequate vitamin D consumption had the largest relative proportion (37.3%). Those with vitamin D deficiency and obesity class I had the lowest average daily intake of vitamin D (3.3 mcg). The correlation between plasma levels of vitamin D and the main indicators of dietary intake in the subjects, separated by sex and anthropometric parameters, revealed the existence of a weak correlation between plasma levels of vitamin D and individual indicators of dietary intake, such as total fat (g; E%), MUFAs (d; E%), PUFAs (d; E%), magnesium, and retinol.  Vitamin D deficiency affects many groups worldwide, including Bulgaria’s elderly citizens. In order to address this severe issue, health experts must design health policies and guidelines based on current and future scientific facts, which will only be available through new studies.', 'Vitamin D deficiency has a high worldwide prevalence, but actions to improve this public health problem are challenged by the heterogeneity of nutritional and clinical vitamin D guidelines, with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin D deficiency. We aimed to address this issue by providing respective recommendations for adults, developed by a European expert panel, using the Delphi method to reach consensus. Increasing the awareness of vitamin D deficiency and efforts to harmonize vitamin D guidelines should be pursued. We argue against a general screening for vitamin D deficiency but suggest 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing in certain risk groups. We recommend a vitamin D supplementation dose of 800 to 2000 international units (IU) per day for adults who want to ensure a sufficient vitamin D status. These doses are also recommended for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency, but higher vitamin D doses (e.g., 6000 IU per day) may be used for the first 4 to 12 weeks of treatment if a rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is clinically indicated before continuing, with a maintenance dose of 800 to 2000 IU per day. Treatment success may be evaluated after at least 6 to 12 weeks in certain risk groups (e.g., patients with malabsorption syndromes) by measurement of serum 25(OH)D, with the aim to target concentrations of 30 to 50 ng/mL (75 to 125 nmol/L).']"

CE diagnosis and monitoring primarily rely on imaging techniques, complemented by serology. This is usually approached by the detection of IgG antibodies against hydatid fluid (HF), but the use of this heterogeneous antigenic mixture results in a variable percentage of false positive and negative results, and has shown to be useless for follow-up due to the long persistence of anti-HF antibodies in cured patients. To improve test performances and standardization, a number of recombinant antigens mainly derived from HF have been described, among them the B2t and 2B2t antigens. The performance of these antigens in the diagnosis and follow up of patients with CE has been so far evaluated on a limited number of samples. Here, we evaluated the performances of tests based on B2t and 2B2t recombinant antigens compared to HF in IgG-ELISA and immunochromatography (IC) for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CE in a retrospective cohort study. A total of 721 serum samples were collected: 587 from 253 patients with CE diagnosed by ultrasonography (US), 42 from patients with alveolar echinococcosis and 92 from healthy donors from Salamanca (Spain). The highest overall sensitivity was obtained with HF in ELISA (85.5%), followed by IC containing HF and 2B2t-HF (83.0% and 78.2%, respectively). The lowest sensitivity was obtained with B2t and 2B2t in ELISA (51.8%). The highest specificity was obtained with IC containing 2B2t-HF (100%), and the lowest with HF-ELISA (78.0%). The lowest cross-reactivity with sera from patients with alveolar echinococcosis was detected with the recombinant antigens in ELISA (9.5% - 16.7%) and the highest with the HF-IC (64.3%). The results of B2t and 2B2t-ELISA were influenced by cyst stage, as classified by US according to the WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE), with low sensitivity for inactive (CE4 and CE5) cysts, and by the drug treatment, with higher sensitivity in patients after drug treatment compared with patients not subjected to drug treatment. The two recombinant antigens in ELISA provided promising results for monitoring patients in follow-up, although their use is limited to patients with positive serology against them at the beginning of the follow-up. Potential biological reasons behind the low sensitivity of the recombinant antigens and possible strategies to enhance the performance of CE serology are discussed.', 'Human echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. The two most important forms of the disease in humans are cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis) and alveolar echinococcosis. Humans are infected through ingestion of parasite eggs in contaminated food, water, or soil, or through direct contact with animal hosts. Although most reported patients with Echinococcosis have cysts in their lungs and livers, more unusual cyst locations were also recorded. Evolution of cysts, irrespective of their localization is associated with many complications including life-threatening. We report unusual localization of parasitic cyst in urinary bladder, diagnostic and therapeutic problems.', ""Although the liver and lung are the most frequently affected organs in cystic echinococcosis, the cysts may develop in any viscera and tissues.

Materials and methods: We performed a literature search in PUBMED using the key words 'hydatid disease', 'cystic echinococcosis' and 'breast echinococcosis' without time limitation. Only studies reporting breast cystic echinococcosis were included.  Overall, 121 cases with cystic echinococcosis and 2 with alveolar echinococcosis were reported. A total of 52 cases were included in the analysis. The mean size of cysts was 5.5 cm (range 1.7-12). The most common clinical presentation was painless lump presented from 4 months to 19 years before the final diagnosis. Most cases had isolated breast CE, few cases had synchronous localizations - femoral, thigh and lung, and previous liver CE. Most were active CL and CE1-2 cysts (72%). Ultrasound was used in 83%, followed by mammography (35%). Fine needle aspiration was reported in 27 cases with positive finding in 59%.  In cases with cystic breast lesions from endemic regions we recommend the US as a gold standard. CT and MRT are more accurate but expensive tools without the potential to change the surgical tactic.

The cutoff value for the percentage of CD117+ cells predicting successful implantation was 0.018% (area under the curve, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.77; sensitivity, 63.1%; specificity, 61.4%). Conclusion(s): This study indicates that the quantity of certain stem cell types (CD117+), but not others (NOTCH1+), in the functional endometrium is associated with implantation success and sex hormone signaling during the midluteal phase. These findings highlight the role of CD117+ cells in preparing the endometrium for embryo implantation, and their quantity may be an indirect indicator of endometrial receptivity.', ""STUDY QUESTION: What changes occur in the endometrium during aging, and do they impact fertility? SUMMARY ANSWER: Both the transcriptome and cellular composition of endometrial samples from women of advanced maternal age (AMA) are significantly different from that of samples from young women, suggesting specific changes in epithelial cells that may affect endometrial receptivity. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Aging is associated with the accumulation of senescent cells in aging tissues. Reproductive aging is mostly attributed to the decline in ovarian reserve and oocyte quality, whereas the endometrium is a unique complex tissue that is monthly renewed under hormonal regulation. Several clinical studies have reported lower implantation and pregnancy rates in oocyte recipients of AMA during IVF. Molecular studies have indicated the presence of specific mutations within the epithelial cells of AMA endometrium, along with altered gene expression of bulk endometrial tissue. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Endometrial transcriptome profiling was performed for 44 women undergoing HRT during the assessment of endometrial receptivity before IVF. Patients younger than 28years were considered as the young maternal age (YMA) group (age 23-27 years) and women older than 45years were considered as the AMA group (age 47-50 years). Endometrial biopsies were obtained on Day 5 of progesterone treatment and RNA was extracted. All endometrial samples were evaluated as being receptive based on the expression of 68 common endometrial receptivity markers. Endometrial samples from another 24 women classified into four age groups (YMA, intermediate age group 1 (IMA1, age 29-35), intermediate age group 2 (IMA2, age 36-44), and AMA) were obtained in the mid-secretory stage of a natural cycle (NC) and used for validation studies across the reproductive lifespan. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING,  A total of 24 HRT samples (12 YMA and 12 AMA) were subject to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and differential gene expression analysis, 20 samples (10 YMA and 10 AMA) were used for qPCR validation, and 24 NC samples (6 YMA, 6 IMA1, 6 IMA2 and 6AMA) were used for RNA-seq validation of AMA genes across the woman's reproductive lifespan. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to confirm some expression changes at the protein level. Computational deconvolution using six endometrial cell type-specific transcriptomic profiles was conducted to compare the cellular composition between the groups. MAIN AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Comparisons between YMA and AMA samples identified a lower proportion of receptive endometria in the AMA group (P=0.007). Gene expression profiling identified 491 differentially expressed age-sensitive genes (P adj < 0.05) that revealed the effects of age on endometrial epithelial growth and receptivity, likely contributing to decreased reproductive performance. Our results indicate that changes in the expression of the cellular senescence marker p16INK4a and genes associated with metabolism, inflammation, and hormone response are involved in endometrial aging. Importantly, we demonstrate that the proportion of multi-ciliated cells, as discovered based on RNA-seq data deconvolution and tissue IHC results, is affected by endometrial aging, and propose a putative onset of age-related changes. Furthermore, we propose that aging has an impact on the transcriptomic profile of endometrial tissue in the context of endometrial receptivity. LARGE SCALE DATA: The raw sequencing data reported in this article are deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession code GSE236128. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This retrospective study identified changes in the endometrium of patients undergoing hormonal replacement and validated these changes using samples obtained during a NC. However, future studies must clarify the importance of these findings on the clinical outcomes of assisted reproduction. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings reported in this study have important implications for devising future strategies aimed at improving fertility management in women of advanced reproductive age."", 'STUDY QUESTION: Does the molecular composition of uterine fluid extracellular vesicles (UF-EVs) reflect endometrial tissue changes across the menstrual cycle? SUMMARY ANSWER: Concordance between endometrial tissue and UF-EVs exists on miRNA and mRNA levels along the menstrual cycle phases and UF-EV surface proteomic signatures suggest EVs originate from several major endometrial cell populations. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The clinical value of endometrial receptivity testing is restricted by invasiveness and the use of only one omics level of input. There is promising evidence that UF-EVs can reflect changes in mid-secretory endometrium, highlighting the potential to establish endometrial receptivity testing right before embryo transfer. However, the dynamic changes of UF-EVs molecular cargo have not been directly compared to endometrial tissue on multiple omics levels. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional study included fertile women from four menstrual cycle phases: proliferative and early-, mid-, and late-secretory phases. In total, 26 paired samples of UF and endometrial tissue were collected. mRNA and miRNA were sequenced, and differential analysis was performed on consecutive phases. UF-EVs were profiled for various protein surface markers associated with different cell types. EVs from epithelial endometrial organoid-conditioned culture media were used as a reference of pure epithelial endometrial EVs. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING,  Paired UF and endometrial tissue samples were collected from 26 fertile, reproductive-age women. EV isolation from UF was validated using electron microscopy and western blotting, and particle numbers were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis. The transcriptome and miRNome of UF-EVs and endometrial tissue were sequenced, and differential expression analysis was conducted on consecutive phases of the menstrual cycle. Bead-based EV flow cytometry targeting 37 surface protein markers was used to characterize EVs from UF and endometrial organoids. MAIN AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Surface proteome analysis revealed that UF-EVs from the mid-secretory phase had significantly increased expression of natural killer cell marker CD56 (P\u2009<\u20090.005), pan-leukocyte marker CD45 (P\u2009<\u20090.005), pan-T-cell marker CD3 (P\u2009<\u20090.005), and coagulation-related protein CD142 (P\u2009<\u20090.005) compared to those from the proliferative phase, whereas markers associated with endometrial epithelial cells (CD29, CD133, and CD326) did not significantly change across the menstrual cycle. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted differential expression of histone and metallothionein genes that correlated between paired UF-EVs and endometrial tissues in each tested menstrual cycle phase. Principal component analysis of miRNomes of paired UF-EVs and endometrial tissue samples resulted in similar clustering patterns, where mid- and late-secretory samples clustered closely, and proliferative and early-secretory phase samples clustered separately. Half of the differentially expressed miRNAs in each phase in UF-EVs were also differentially expressed in the endometrium. Importantly, nine mid-secretory phase UF-EV DE miRNAs were identified, five of which were common between UF-EVs and endometrial biopsies, including hsa-miR-30d-5p and hsa-miR-200b-3p, both of which were previously implicated in implantation. Notably, three of the nine miRNAs, hsa-miR-200b-3p, hsa-miR-141-3p, and hsa-miR-200a-3p, were predicted to regulate mRNAs in the endometrial tissue and the pre-implantation embryo trophectoderm. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The clinical dating of the menstrual cycle phase is based on the first day of menstruation and the time of the LH peak, which does not exclude the possibility that the expected endometrial phase was not reached. The wider limitation of our study is the lack of standardized procedures for collecting UF samples in gynaecological practice, which could challenge the replication of our findings. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Evidence that UF-EVs reflect endometrial phases of menstrual cycle supports the use of UF-EVs in endometrial receptivity testing. Additionally, further studies of UF-EVs in endometrial pathologies could be beneficial for diagnostics, considering that more invasive tissue biopsies only reflect the biopsy site and not the full endometrium.']"

Glucosamine has been clinically introduced for the treatment of osteoarthritis but the data about its protective role in disease are insufficient. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of long term administration of glucosamine on bone resorption and remodeling. The effect of glucosamine on bone resorption and remodeling was studied in a model of collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA). The levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, protein regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES), soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6, 4 and 10 in synovial fluid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell populations in synovial extracts and the expression of RANKL, of receptors for TNF-α (TNF-αR) and interferon γ (IFN-γR) on clusters of differentiation (CD) three positive T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, phosphorylated protein mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (pSMAD-2), RANKL and Dickkopf-1 protein (DKK-1) positive staining in CIOA joints were determined by immunohistochemistry. The administration of glucosamine hydrochloride in CIOA mice inhibited loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) in cartilage, bone erosion and osteophyte formation. It decreased the levels of soluble RANKL and IL-6 and induced IL-10 increase in the CIOA joint fluids. Glucosamine limited the number of CD11b positive Ly6G neutrophils and RANKL positive CD3 T cells in the joint extracts. It suppressed bone resorption via down-regulation of RANKL expression and affected bone remodeling in CIOA by decreasing BMP-2, TGF-β3 and pSMAD-2 expression and up-regulating DKK-1 joint levels. Our data suggest that glucosamine hydrochloride inhibits bone resorption through down-regulation of RANKL expression in the joints, via reduction of the number of RANKL positive CD3 T cells and the level of sRANKL in the joints extracts. These effects of glucosamine appear to be critical for the progression of CIOA and result in limited bone remodeling of the joints.', 'The aim of our study was to analyze the level of the glycoprotein YKL-40 in patients with active knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to search possible correlations with local inflammation and ultrasound (US) findings. Material and methods: A prospective study with fifty consecutive patients with active knee OA (diagnosed based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria for OA with radiographic confirmation) was performed. Concentrations of YKL-40 in serum and synovial fluid were measured by ELISA. US examinations - Gray scale (GS) US and Power Doppler (PD) US - of the knee was performed according to international guidelines. The suprapatellar, medial and lateral parapatellar recesses were scanned in each knee to evaluate synovial hypertrophy and vascularization.  Forty women (mean age 61.50±11.33 years old) and 10 men (aged 68.50±6.60 years old) were enrolled. We found that the synovial level of the glycoprotein (237.80±104.08 ng/ml) was significantly higher compared to the serum concentration (112.83±60.61 ng/ml, p < 0.001). The serum concentration in OA patients was higher comparing with age-matched healthy controls (84.19±11.39 ng/ml) (p < 0.05). A statistically significant association between YKL- 40 in synovial fluid and serum levels was shown. We determined a moderately positive linear relationship between the synovial level of the glycoprotein and the serum concentration. No association between the levels of inflammatory markers - erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein - and YKL-40 concentrations was detected. Our study revealed a strong relationship between YKL-40 in synovial fluid and GS US and feeble with PD US. YKL-40 correlated with inflammatory activity in knee joints and neovascularization detected by US.  YKL-40 is involved in the pathogenesis of OA synovitis. Evaluation of YKL-40 levels in parallel with US might provide more sensitive and reliable information for the diagnosis and understanding of OA.', 'Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease causing progressive damages of the cartilage and subchondral bone, synovial inflammation, and severe pain. Despite the complex pathomorphological changes that occur in OA, the approach to different forms of OA is standardized. The global results from pharmacological treatment are not satisfactory. Hence, this study aimed to explore the effects of metformin, alendronate, and their combination on OA development and progression in mice with collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA). Female ICR (CD-2) mice were randomized to five groups: control group, CIOA untreated, CIOA + metformin, CIOA + alendronate, and CIOA + metformin + alendronate. OA was induced by the intra-articular (i.a.) injection of collagenase. OA phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry (bone marrow cell dif-ferentiation), ELISA (serum levels of the adipokines leptin and resistin), and histology (pathological changes of the knee joint). Treatment with metformin, alendronate, or their combination inhibited the expression of RANK and RANKL on osteoblasts and osteoclasts obtained by ex vivo cultivation of bone marrow cells in mineralization or osteoclastogenic media. In addition, metformin treatment was effective for the attenuation of fibroblast differentiation, but not of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), while alendronate had an opposite effect. The combination of metformin and alendronate had a suppressive effect on both MSCs and fibroblasts differentiation. Treatment with metformin, alendronate, and their combination decreased serum concentrations of leptin and resistin in the chronic phase of arthritis. The histopathological examination showed that compared with the untreated CIOA group (OA score 9), the groups treated with metformin (OA score 4) or alendronate (OA score 6) had lower scores for cartilage changes. Metformin combined with alendronate significantly decreased the degree of cartilage degeneration (OA score 2), suggesting that this combination might be a useful approach for the treatment of OA patients.']"

Although AI is in its infancy, it has shown great promise in the diagnosis of oncologic urological conditions. This paper aims to explore the expanding role of artificial intelligence in the histopathological diagnosis in urological oncology. We conducted a focused review of the literature on AI in urological oncology, searching PubMed and Google Scholar for recent advancements in histopathological diagnosis using AI. Various keyword combinations were used to find relevant sources published before April 2nd, 2024. We approached this article by focusing on the impact of AI on common urological malignancies by incorporating the use of different AI algorithms. We targeted the capabilities of AI’s potential in aiding urologists and pathologists in histological cancer diagnosis. Promising results suggest AI can enhance diagnosis and personalized patient care, yet further refinements are needed before widespread hospital adoption. AI is transforming urological oncology by improving histopathological diagnosis and patient care. This review highlights AI’s advancements in diagnosing prostate, renal cell, and bladder cancer. It is anticipated that as AI becomes more integrated into clinical practice, it will have a greater influence on diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.', 'The aim of this review is to explore the role of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, how it impacts CRC morbidity and mortality, and why its role in clinical medicine is limited.  A targeted, non-systematic review of the published literature relating to colorectal cancer diagnosis was performed with PubMed databases that were scouted to help provide a more defined understanding of the recent advances regarding artificial intelligence and their impact on colorectal-related morbidity and mortality. Articles were included if deemed relevant and including information associated with the keywords.  The advancements in artificial intelligence have been significant in facilitating an earlier diagnosis of CRC. In this review, we focused on evaluating genomic biomarkers, the integration of instruments with artificial intelligence, MR and hyperspectral imaging, and the architecture of neural networks. We found that these neural networks seem practical and yield positive results in initial testing. Furthermore, we explored the use of deep-learning-based majority voting methods, such as bag of words and PAHLI, in improving diagnostic accuracy in colorectal cancer detection. Alongside this, the autonomous and expansive learning ability of artificial intelligence, coupled with its ability to extract increasingly complex features from images or videos without human reliance, highlight its impact in the diagnostic sector. Despite this, as most of the research involves a small sample of patients, a diversification of patient data is needed to enhance cohort stratification for a more sensitive and specific neural model. We also examined the successful application of artificial intelligence in predicting microsatellite instability, showcasing its potential in stratifying patients for targeted therapies.  Since its commencement in colorectal cancer, artificial intelligence has revealed a multitude of functionalities and augmentations in the diagnostic sector of CRC. Given its early implementation, its clinical application remains a fair way away, but with steady research dedicated to improving neural architecture and expanding its applicational range, there is hope that these advanced neural software could directly impact the early diagnosis of CRC. The true promise of artificial intelligence, extending beyond the medical sector, lies in its potential to significantly influence the future landscape of CRC’s morbidity and mortality.', 'and objectives: This review aims to delve into the role of artificial intelligence in medicine. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by superficial mucosal inflammation, rectal bleeding, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. By identifying the challenges inherent in UC diagnosis, we seek to highlight the potential impact of artificial intelligence on enhancing both diagnosis and treatment methodologies for this condition. Method: A targeted, non-systematic review of literature relating to ulcerative colitis was undertaken. The PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to categorize a well-rounded understanding of the field of artificial intelligence and its developing role in the diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis. Articles that were thought to be relevant were included. This paper only included articles published in English.  Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer algorithms capable of learning, problem solving and decision-making. Throughout our review, we highlighted the role and importance of artificial intelligence in modern medicine, emphasizing its role in diagnosis through AI-assisted endoscopies and histology analysis and its enhancements in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Despite these advances, AI is still hindered due to its current lack of adaptability to real-world scenarios and its difficulty in widespread data availability, which hinders the growth of AI-led data analysis.  When considering the potential of artificial intelligence, its ability to enhance patient care from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective shows signs of promise. For the true utilization of artificial intelligence, some roadblocks must be addressed. The datasets available to AI may not truly reflect the real-world, which would prevent its impact in all clinical scenarios when dealing with a spectrum of patients with different backgrounds and presenting factors. Considering this, the shift in medical diagnostics and therapeutics is coinciding with evolving technology. With a continuous advancement in artificial intelligence programming and a perpetual surge in patient datasets, these networks can be further enhanced and supplemented with a greater cohort, enabling better outcomes and prediction models for the future of modern medicine.']"

However, biomolecular recognition in real cellular systems is not always as selective as desired. A new concept for creating fluorescent biomolecular probes, utilizing a fluorogenic dye and biodegradable, biocompatible nanomaterials, is demonstrated. The synthesis of a new dicationic asymmetric monomethine cyanine dye with benzo[d]thiazolium-N-propionamide and chloroquinoline end groups is presented. The photophysical properties of the newly synthesized dye were examined through the combined application of spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The applicability of the dye as a fluorogenic nucleic acid probe was proven by UV-VIS spectroscopy and fluorescence titration. The dye–nucleic acid interaction mode was investigated by UV-Vis and CD spectroscopy. The newly synthesized dicationic dye, like other similar fluorogenic structures, limited permeability, which restricts its use as a probe for RNA and DNA. To enhance cellular delivery, we utilized a patented technology that employs solid, insoluble lipid nanoparticles. This method ensures the complete introduction of the dye into cells while minimizing activity outside the cells. In our study involving two human cell lines, we observed improved penetration through the cell membrane and distinctive selectivity in visualizing nucleic acids within the cytoplasm and nucleus.', 'During the past decades, increasing attention has been given to elucidating the molecular details of interactions between the pharmacological agents and nucleic acids since the drug–DNA complexation may lead to impairment of DNA replication, strand breaking and mutations. A variety of techniques have been developed to characterize the drug-nucleic acid binding, among which the fluorescence dye displacement assay is one of the most informative approaches. Recently, it was demonstrated that cyanine dyes can be successfully employed for the high throughput screening of the interactions between nucleic acids and drugs. To the best of our knowledge, so far, the potential application of cyanine dyes for the drug-displacement studies remains insufficiently evaluated.  The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of a novel cyanine dye to serve as a competitor for the potential antitumor compounds, lanthanide complexes bearing europium (III) tris-β-diketonate (EC) for the DNA and RNA binding sites. Materials and methods: Calf thymus DNA, yeast RNA, trimethine cyanine dye and lanthanide complexes bearing europium (III) tris-β-diketonate were used for sample preparation. The fluorescence data were acquired using Perkin-Elmer LS-55 spectrofluorimeter.  Using the fluorescence spectroscopy technique we conducted the displacement reaction trimethine cyanine dye/europium coordination complexes in the presence of double stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA. An increase of the EC concentration in the systems AK3-5/DNA or AK3-5/RNA was followed by a gradual reduction in the AK3-5 fluorescence intensity, indicating that europium (III) tris-β-diketonate compounds can serve as competitors for the trimethine cyanine dye on the nucleic acids. Both the drug chemical structure and the type of nucleic acid proved to control the extent of EC-induced decrease of AK3-5 fluorescence in the presence of the DNA or RNA.  By recruiting the potential antitumor agents europium chelate complexes as the competitive ligands for the cyanine dye for the DNA and RNA binding sites, we found that a novel trimethine compound can be effectively used in the fluorescence drug displacement assays.', 'Two new asymmetric monomethine cyanine dyes, featuring dimethoxy quinolinium or methyl quinolinium end groups and benzothiazole or methyl benzothiazole end groups were synthesized. The chemical structures of the two dyes—(E)-6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-4-((3-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)methyl)quinolin-1-ium iodide (3a) and (E)-4-((3,5-dimethylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)methyl)-1,2-dimethylquinolin-1-ium iodide (3b)—were confirmed through NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A new methodology was developed to study monocationic dyes in the absence of a matrix and cationizing compounds in MALDI-TOF mass experiments. The newly synthesized dyes contain hydrophobic functional groups attached to the chromophore, enhancing their affinity for the hydrophobic regions of nucleic acids within the biological matrix. The dyes’ photophysical properties were investigated in aqueous solutions and DMSO, as well as in the presence of nucleic acids. The dyes exhibit notable aggregachromism in both pure aqueous and buffered solutions. The observed aggregation phenomena were further elucidated using computational methods. Fluorescence titration experiments revealed that upon contact with nucleic acids, the dyes exhibit bioaggregachromism–aggregachromism on the surfaces of the respective biomolecular matrix (RNA or DNA). This bioaggregachromism was further confirmed by CD spectroscopy. Given the pronounced aggregachromism detected, we conclude that the dyes investigated in this study are highly suitable for use as fluorogenic probes in biomolecular recognition techniques. The unique absorption and fluorescence spectra of these dyes make them promising fluorogenic markers for various bioanalytical methods related to biomolecular recognition.']"

This is the first systematic investigation of the needs, access to services, and priorities of families of children with developmental disorders in the country.  The study aims to: (1) characterize the needs of children with developmental disorders in Bulgaria; (2) to compare the needs and access to services of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (oNDD); (3) and to examine the daily burden of their caregivers and how it varies based on their demographic characteristics, such as income and education.  We used an online family needs assessment survey to collect data from caregivers of children with developmental disorders in Bulgaria between April and July 2020. 195 parents of children with ASD and 73 parents of children with oNDD completed the questionnaire.  Children with ASD waited longer than children with oNDD to receive a diagnosis. Caregivers in the ASD group also expressed first concerns about their child’s development when their children were older and for different reasons than caregivers in the oNDD group. There were no significant differences between groups in service encounters, including access to and delay of medical, counseling, and educational services, with approximately 50% of all caregivers experiencing some delay and/or difficulties in access to services. There were no associations between access to services and caregiver education and family income, with the exception of higher education being linked to receiving a diagnosis earlier for the oNDD group. Discussion: This study has three main findings: (1) children with ASD and children with oNDD in Bulgaria have different needs and paths to diagnosis; (2) nevertheless, children in both groups experience similar challenges in accessing medical, counseling, and educational services, regardless of their demographic characteristics; and (3) parents’ priorities focus on education, counseling, and medical support, protecting children’s basic rights, and raising awareness. A comparison of our findings to past research in the region shows a relative improvement in diagnostic services with families not having to travel outside their city to receive a diagnosis. Based on our findings, we provide specific recommendations for changes in services and policy.', 'There is very little knowledge regarding autistic adult services, practices, and delivery. The study objective was to improve understanding of current services and practices for autistic adults and opportunities for improvement as part of the Autism Spectrum Disorder in the European Union (ASDEU) project. Separate survey versions were created for autistic adults, carers of autistic adults, and professionals in adult services. 2,009 persons responded to the survey and 1,085 (54%) of them completed at least one of the services sections: 469 autistic adults (65% female; 55% <35 years old), 441 carers of autistic adults (27% female; 6% <35 years old), 175 professionals in adult services (76% female; 67% in non-medical services). Top choices by autistic adults, carers or professionals for services best suiting their current needs were: residential services: “help in own home” (adults, carers of high independent adults, professionals), “fulltime residential facility” (carers of low independent adults); employment services: “job mentors” (adults, carers of high independent adults, professionals), “Sheltered employment” (carers of low independent adults); education services: “support in regular education setting” (all groups); financial services: financial support in lieu of employment (“Supplementary income for persons unable to have full employment” for adults, “full pension” for carers of low independent adults) or to supplement employment earnings for carers of high independent adults and professionals; social services: “behavior training” (adults) and “life skills training” (carers and professionals). Waiting times for specific services were generally < 1 month or 1–3 months, except for residential services which could be up to 6 months; most professionals were uninformed of waiting times (>50% responded “don’t know”). Five of seven residential services features recommended for autistic adults were experienced by <50% of adults. The knowledge of good local services models that work well for autistic adults was generally low across all services areas. The variation in services experiences and perceptions reported by autistic adults, carers, or professionals underscore the need to query all groups for a complete picture of community services availability and needs. The results showed areas for potential improvement in autistic adult services delivery in the EU to achieve recommended standards.', ""The Autism Spectrum Disorders in the European Union (ASDEU) survey investigated the knowledge and health service experiences of users and providers to generate new hypotheses and scientific investigations that would contribute to improvement in health care for autistic adults. An online survey designed for autistic adults, carers of autistic adults, and professionals in adult services was translated into 11 languages and distributed electronically by organizations and in-country adult service facilities in 2017; 522 autistic adults, 442 carers, and 113 professionals provided answers to the health questions. Professionals, the majority in non-medical services, appeared to be poorly informed about whether certain co-occurring conditions were more frequent in autistic adults than typical adults—especially some medical conditions, suicide attempts, accidents, and pain. A minority of autistic adults reported preventive health behaviors such as routine health check-ups. The majority of users and providers expressed the desire to make health care services more user-friendly for autistic adults. Among the three groups, <20% of responders knew an organization or clinician which has developed a way to monitor health, and prevent poor health, that works well for adults on the autism spectrum. The results point to means for better management of co-occurring conditions associated with autism in adulthood in order to reduce hospital admissions and potential areas of improvement in health and social services for autistic adults.

As far as we know, the rate of incidence for the syndrome is 0.02 per 10,000 births. It is estimated that Meckel-Gruber syndrome accounts for 5% of all neural tube defects in Finland.  The aim of this study is to present a case of a fetus with Meckel-Gruber syndrome associated with complete left isomerism. Method. The fetus was obtained after medical interruption of the pregnancy during the fifteenth gestational week. The mother was 36 years old and in a consanguineous marriage. The antenatal ultrasound examination revealed a polymalformative syndrome, leading to a postmortem examination. The fetopathological study of the fetus was conducted at the Centre for Maternity and Neonatology, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2008.  The female fetus had a significantly deformed ballooning abdomen, pes equinovarus, flexion of the wrist and a total posterior cleft palate. The central nervous system abnormalities were occipital encephalocele, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, agenesis of corpus callosum and hydrocephalus. The study of the internal organs found dextrocardia, irregular lobulation of the lungs, left isomerism, and polysplenia. The microscopic examination revealed bilateral cystic dilation of the kidneys, fibrous proliferation of the liver and ectasic dilatation of the billiary ducts, representing a ductal plate malformation of the liver.  The case is diagnosed with Meckel-Gruber syndrome associated with complete left isomerism, cleft palate and possibly Dandy-Walker syndrome.', 'Mermaid syndrome or sirenomelia is an extremely rare congenital malformation with an incidence between 1.5 and 4.2 per 1,000,000 pregnancies. Association of mermaid syndrome with VACTERL-H syndrome is extremely rare, with only two cases reported so far in the literature. We present a new case of type I sirenomelia associated with VACTERL-H syndrome and review the relevant literature. A 15-year-old female patient was admitted to the Department of Pathological Pregnancy at St George University Hospital, Plovdiv with progredient abortion during her first pregnancy. She had low socioeconomic status, negative history of concomitant diseases and addictions. The patient avoided prophylactic intake of folic acid during her pregnancy. Prenatal ultrasound found a malformative fetus. Consequently, magnetic resonance imaging was performed which established the presence of hydrocephalus and defects in the lower part of the spine. These pathological findings indicated interruption of pregnancy at 20 weeks of gestation. The fetopathological examination found sirenomelia type I associated with myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, anal imperforation, single umbilical artery, bilateral renal and ureteric agenesis, bladder agenesis, tracheo-esophageal fistula, agenesis of external genitals, monkey fold of the left palm of the hand, also known as VACTERL-H syndrome. Our case demonstrates that mermaid syndrome and VACTERL-H syndrome represent different manifestations of a single pathological process that results in disorders of the blastogenesis at different stages during embryonic development.', 'The aim of the study was to determine the role of inbreeding in occurrence of lethal congenital hydrocephalus (LCH) and congenital abnormalities associated with it. Materials and methods: There was an examination of 182 fetuses born with LCH, out of which 69 were diagnosed with isolated and 113 fetuses were diagnosed with associated hydrocephalus resulting in 38% and 62% occurrences, respectively. All the fetuses were the result of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and the pregnancy terminations due to medical reasons. The fetal autopsy was performed immediately after the fetal expulsion. The brain examination was performed after being preserved in 10% formalin solution for the period of 6 months. Measurements were taken on the ventricles in their central parts. Ventricles with the enlargements over 10 mm were determined as hydrocephalus and severe ventriculomegaly if the ventricular dimensions were over 15 mm.  Lethal congenital hydrocephalus associated with were the presence of previous pregnancies with inbreeding and malformations [OR = 7.309 CI 95% (1.806–29.584)]; the maternal age over 40 and the third-degree inbreeding in fetus [OR = 18.500 CI 95% (1.410–638.150)]; agenesis of the corpus callosum in fetuses born from mothers in close relative marriages [OR = 30.000 CI 95% (1.410–638.150)]; aqueductal stenosis [OR = 9.867 CI 95% (1.328–73.296)]; skeletal dysplasia [OR = 6.727 CI 95% (1.203–37.609)]; and Dandy–Walker syndrome [OR = 6.250 CI 95% (0.803–48.671)].  The obtained results unambiguously prove the importance and significance of inbreeding as a risk factor of LCH appearance and its increase in association with other risk factors which should be taken into consideration when observing such pregnancies. Clinical significance: Lethal congenital hydrocephalus is the result of a significant number of risk factors and is often associated with other malformations. Currently, prenatal ultrasound is able to visualize ventriculomegaly. It is important to gather information about the previous pregnancies and the type of marriage among close relatives. In case of ventriculomegaly it is imperative to carry out MRI and genetic testing that can provide additional information. In the case of medical abortion, stillbirth or neonatal death, a fetopathological study must be carried out which enriches our knowledge of malformations, complements and directs the ultrasound examination, modifies genetic counseling and determines the behavior to be followed when taking responsibility for a new, subsequent pregnancy.']"

In total, 266 consecutive H. pylori strains, from untreated symptomatic adult patients who answered a questionnaire, were evaluated. Strain susceptibility to amoxicillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin and tetracycline was tested by a breakpoint susceptibility test. Metronidazole resistance was found in fewer (17.0%) peptic ulcer patients than in non-ulcer subjects (28.3 %, P=0.037), as well as in fewer patients born in villages (12.7%) than in those born in towns (27.6%, P=0.016). Clarithromycin resistance varied from 8.8 to 23.4 % (P=0.009) within the hospital centres. The highest clarithromycin resistance rate was found in hospital centre A (23.4 %) compared to other centres (12.9 %, P=0.041). The factors sex, age, symptom duration, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, diabetes, type of profession and educational level were not associated with H. pylori resistance. Logistic regression revealed that the risk factors for metronidazole resistance were non-ulcer disease [odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1.04-3.65] and a birthplace of a town (OR 2.64, 95 % CI 1.18-5.93). The hospital centre may be a risk factor (OR 2.07, 95 % CI 1.02-4.21) for clarithromycin resistance but further studies are required to verify this suggestion. In conclusion, the knowledge of the risk factors for H. pylori resistance to antibacterials could facilitate the treatment choice for H. pylori eradication.', 'Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common bacterial infection worldwide and one of the main etiological factors of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and stomach neoplasms. The mass application of antibiotics without testing, especially during the last years of the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, could lead to a dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance and reduced effectiveness of eradication regimens for H. pylori infection. The epidemiology of H. pylori resistance to antibiotics still has unclear mechanisms. Antibiotic policy should be intensified to optimize treatment, and regular monitoring of resistance of H. pylori in different geographical regions should be conducted. Individualized treatment according to susceptibility testing is strongly advisable, and the best treatment regimens should be selected. The mutations in the genes encoding the antibiotic target protein are significant risk factors for H. pylori resistance. Iatrogenic errors in diagnosis and prescribing treatment for the failure of H. pylori eradication are other important risk factors. The low level of awareness and compliance with the correct treatment influence the rate of H. pylori resistance. Epidemiological surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the adoption of new treatment strategies are needed. The discovery of an efficient vaccine against H. pylori could reduce the pressure of the world’s growing antibiotic resistance.', 'The aim of this study was to evaluate the primary and combined resistance of Helicobacter pylori against four antimicrobial agents by a screening agar method (SAM) and a modified disk diffusion method (MDDM) alone and in combination. Pre-treatment H. pylori isolates from 192 consecutive H. pylori-positive patients at three hospitals in Sofia were investigated. MDDM was performed with disks containing metronidazole (5 μg) clarithromycin (15 μg) or erythromycin (15 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg) and tetracycline (30 μg). Resistance was determined by an inhibitory zone of <16 mm for metronidazole and ≤30 mm for other agents tested. The cut-off concentrations used to define resistance by SAM were: metronidazole >8 mg/L, clarithromycin >2 mg/L, tetracycline >4 mg/L and ciprofloxacin >1 mg/L. Primary resistance rates in H. pylori were: metronidazole 28.6%, clarithromycin 9.7%, metronidazole + clarithromycin 2.8%, ciprofloxacin 3.9%, metronidazole + ciprofloxacin 2.3%, tetracycline 1.9% and metronidazole + tetracycline 1.2%. Among metronidazole-resistant isolates, combined resistance to clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was present in 11.4% (5 of 44 strains), 8.3% (3 of 36) and 4.9% (2 of 41), respectively. Two strains exhibited triple resistance to macrolides, metronidazole and either ciprofloxacin or tetracycline. Three tetracycline-resistant strains were detected in 1999; however, resistance rates to other agents were relatively stable during the 6 years. Primary H. pylori resistance to metronidazole is moderate and resistance to clarithromycin and to ciprofloxacin is considerable in comparison with results in most other countries. The alarming appearance of strains harbouring combined resistance or multiresistance provides the motivation for continued surveillance of H. pylori at global, national regional levels.']"
