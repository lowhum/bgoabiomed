This open-label phase II study was conducted in 9 centres in Belgium, Spain, and Bulgaria between 2016 and 2019. The primary objective was to assess the safety of HALPC therapy up to Day 28 and the secondary objectives were to assess its safety and preliminary efficacy up to Month 3.  The 24 treated patients (mean age: 51 years) were mostly male with an alcoholic cirrhosis. On pre-infusion Day 1,15 patients had ACLF and 9 patients had AD. Two of the 3 initial patients treated with high HALPC doses (similar to 5x10(6) cells/kg body weight [BW]) had severe adverse bleeding events attributed to treatment. In 21 patients subsequently treated with lower HALPC doses (0.6 or 1.2x10(6) cells/kg BW, 1 or 2 times 7 days apart), no serious adverse events were related to treatment, and the other adverse events were in line with those expected in patients with ACLF and AD. Overall, markers of systemic inflammation and altered liver function decreased gradually for the surviving patients. The Day-28 and Month-3 survival rates were 83% (20/24) and 71% (17/24), and at Month 3, no patient had ACLF.  The treatment of patients with ACLF or AD with up to 2 doses of 1.2x10(6) HALPC/kg BW appeared safe. The results of this study support the initiation of a proof-of-concept study in a larger cohort of patients with ACLF to further confirm the safety and evaluate the efficacy of HALPC therapy. Clinical Trials Registration: EudraCT 2016-001177-32. Lay summary: Patients with liver cirrhosis may suffer from the rapid onset of organ failure or multiple organ failure associated with a high risk of death in the short term. This clinical study of 24 patients suggests that an advanced therapy based on the intravenous infusion of low doses of human allogeneic liver-derived progenitor cells is safe and supports the next phase of clinical development of this type of therapy.', 'Stress is a phenomenon accompanying everyday life. Various reactions of the body are activated during stress, including activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal endocrine axis and the autonomous nervous system. Their activity could be assessed by the measurement of biological stress marker molecules - salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol - on one side and heart rate, and blood pressure monitoring, on the other. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the daily professional routines cause stress development among general practitioners (GPs) who work in rural, distant areas in the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria One hundred and twenty-eight GPs were asked to answer a questionnaire to assess their health conditions, habits, priority objectives and interests, as well as their moral and ethical relationships with the patients. On this basis 40 participants were selected and outlined for the present survey (n=40, mean age 55.92 +/- 8.8). Four salivary samples were collected from each participant during 1 week: two on Monday (one in the morning and one after work) and two on Friday, by the same mechanism. The salivary samples collection was followed by measurement of blood pressure and pulse. This non-invasive survey was based on an ELISA method for quantitative determination of the marker molecules in saliva. The blood pressure and pulse were measured by blood pressure monitor. The levels of the salivary alpha-amylase were significantly higher at the end of the working day, especially on Friday (142.28 +/- 23.34 U/mL, p=0.018), but not between the beginning and the end of the week. The normal cortisol awakening response, characterized by a peak in the levels of cortisol after wake-up, followed by a slow decrease during the day, was detected only at the beginning of the week. The data show a significant impairment of this regularity at the end of the week. Moreover, the levels of cortisol, measured for the morning samples, show a decrease at the end of the week (25.73 +/- 10.51 ng/mL) in comparison to the beginning of the week (30.1 +/- 10.84, p=0.033). The analyses on the effect of smoking (p=0.002) and alcohol consumption (p=0.036) on stress development show a significant increase in the levels of the salivary alpha-amylase, but not on the levels of salivary cortisol. The changes in the blood pressure indicate stress development at the end of the week (p=0.04), while the pulse showed changes within a day rather than during the week. The values of the pulse were higher at the end of the day. The professional lives of the GPs who work in distant and rural places are associated with stress development. Different habits from the daily routine, such as alcohol consumption, smoking and physical activity, could be considered as modulators of stress development.', 'Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) provides HIV-infected people life expectancy comparable with HIV-uninfected people and turns the disease into a manageable chronic condition necessitating the need for innovative inflammatory markers. Our purpose was to determine the correlation between IL-6, D-dimer and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels among HIV-infected and the presence of chronic inflammation during general and immunological aging and drug exposure.Material and methods: Comparative prospective study was conducted at 37 HIV-positive persons from the Center for Monitoring and Treatment of HIV-positive Patients at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases, UMBAL Dr. G. Stranski - Pleven (target group) and 18 HIV-negative individuals from outpatient practice (control group), aged e18 years.  The median age of seropositive persons was 40 years (24 divided by 70 years), of the control group - 51 years (29 divided by 72 years); 78% of the target group and 61% of the controls are men. The average duration of ART is 4 years (1 divided by 9 years). The study of specified biomarkers in the target group found increased IL-6 in 8.11% of patients (mean 3.67 +/- 1.86 pg/mL; range 1.5 divided by 8.62; 95% CI 3.11-5.02), increased D-dimer in 8.11% (mean 0.37 +/- 0.28 mu g/mL; 0.21 divided by 1.96; 95% CI 0.3691-0.37459) and increased hsCRP in 10.81% (mean 2.10 +/- 1.99 mu g/mL; 0.19 divided by 7.0; 95% CI 1.89-2.31). In the control group IL-6 was not increased (mean 2.75 +/- 1.67 pg/mL; 1.5 divided by 6.91), D-dimer was increased in 16.67% (mean 0.37 +/- 0.17 mu g/mL; 0.09 divided by 0.8) and increased hsCRP - in 5.56% (mean 1.76 +/- 1.75 mu g/mL; 0.19 divided by 5.66). Il-6 was significantly higher in the target group. The implementation of sensitive biomarkers is crucial in the general diagnostic-therapeutic approach in aging with HIV.']"

Sometimes the anatomical complexity of the root canal system makes complete removal of bacteria almost impossible even if the conventional methods of chemo-mechanical debridement are performed strictly according to the protocol. So additional methods of root canal disinfection can be applied such as photoactivated disinfection (PAD).  The aim of our study was to compare the antibacterial activity of PAD with FotoSan, and conventional endodontic therapy in the treatment of infected root canals. Materials and methods: The study involved 36 teeth of patients who are diagnosed with pulp necrosis or with the periapical chronic periodontitis and require endodontic treatment and divided into two groups of 18 teeth each. The first microbiological sample was taken by placing a sterile paper point in the root canal, after endodontic access cavity preparation. All root canals are prepared by Protaper Universal rotary instruments (Maillefer Instruments SA, Ballaigues, Switzerland). In the first group, the disinfection of the root canals was made with photoactivated disinfection with FotoSan. In the second group was performed the endodontic treatment with the standard protocol of irrigation - 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution and 17% EDTA. After that, the root canals are dried with sterile points, and a second microbiological sample is taken.  In all compared pairs, there was no significantly different effect regarding the number of microorganisms. Conclusions; The disinfection with NaOCl has the strongest antimicrobial effect in this study. Second place is occupied by PAD with FotoSan. We believe that the established antimicrobial effect of PAD make the method appropriate as complementary to routine endodontic treatment.', 'Every clinician encounter isses with problematic periodontal tissue around teeth intended to be treatet prosthetically. Swollen, reddish, with deeper periodontal pockets and and impossible to dry up with air flow. Such teeth should be treated rapidly and minimally invasive. The purpose of this study was to create an algorithm for periodontal tooth preparation with Er-YAG laser before prosthetic treatment. Material/ It was used examination and diagnosis of teeth for the purpose of prosthodontic treatment according to the periodontal status by using UNC 15 perio-probe and electronic periodontal probe Pa-On and Er-YAG dental laser. There were examined 216 periodontal units, 106 of them treated according to the suggested protocol. An innovative approach was used by considering all treated teeth suitable for impression by the visual indicator -periodontal margin condition (lack of inflammatory symptoms, lack of bleeding, lack of redness, presence of pink, dense gingiva. Record of the day with pink gingiva appear was made.  216 units measured with a conventional and electronic periodontal probe in inflammatory status and after periodontal treatment. It was registered a significant difference between the data from the conventional periodontal probe and the electronic one. Teeth prepared for prosthetic treatment were 106. By using a blind randomized clinical trial, 50% of them were prepared for prosthetic impression by using ultrasonic and the other half by using Er-YAG laser. Teeth prepared for Prosthodontic impression are heathy between 2nd and 7th day after preparation (61.54% -2nd day; 38.46% - 7th day) while the controlled group is between the 14th and the 21st day (33.33% -14th day; 62.96% - 21st day). The total amount of attachment gain in such a short period of time by the protocol suggested by the authors is 1mm.  Considerable dental units show difference in periodontal pocket depth measurement to such degree that could lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Great difference is observed mainly between gingival pocket depth and superficial periodontitis.', 'The diagnosis avulsion of permanent tooth/teeth is an emergency situation which has special requirements in respect of proper storage of the avulsed tooth, the need of urgent medical/dental care, time past till replantation and splinting, the need for endodontic treatment and long term follow up period. Those clinical actions depend on three groups: parents/people who are with the child in the moment when trauma happens and give the first aid; dental specialist-surgeon who replants the tooth/teeth; dental specialist-endodontist who takes care of the endodontic treatment and the long period after treatment for follow up and observation of the replanted teeth. The aim of the paper is to present the dental postoperative care in a couple of cases of children with trauma and replanted avulsed permanent incisors. Material and methods: We present four clinical cases of children who get 6 permanent upper incisors replanted. Replantation is made by the oral surgeon. Treatment and observation after replantation are made by dental specialists of pediatric dentistry and conservative dentistry. All 4 cases get 3 years follow up period.  After replantation of 2 central incisors with complete root development (first clinical case) the left one has developed a resorption of the root but the right one is in a stable condition. Replantation of 3 teeth with incomplete root development (second and third clinical cases) where the patients refer to specialized surgical care less than 60 minutes after injury and store the teeth in different ways lead to different clinical results. In the case of avulsed upper right incisor (second case), it is stored in milk and we observe revascularization followed by partial root canal obliteration. The tooth is scheduled for endodontic treatment. In the case of upper central incisors, both kept dry till replantation in the alveolus filled up with substitute bone, we observe fast root resorption which going to lead to early tooth loss. After replantation of the first upper incisor with open apex, stored in physiological solution for 5 hours and with delayed endodontic treatment forth case) healing process is stable and the prognosis is good. Follow up period for all the replanted teeth has continued.  The presented clinical cases show that there is a lack of dental teams for complex treatment of children with avulsed teeth in Bulgaria. Dental specialists have no good information about recommended by IADT protocols (www.iadt-dentaltrauma.org), for the treatment of teeth undergoes avulsion during childhood. Parents of these children have no proper information about how to store the teeth which are avulsed and found immediately after trauma.']"

The total phenolic content was performed using the Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent. To determine the antioxidant activities of the extracts, several complementary tests were used: ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay. The phenolic concentration was 15.98 +/- 0.09 and 9.42 +/- 0.06 mg GAE g(-1) DW for 70 and 85% ethanol extracts, respectively. Of all the performed methods, the highest antioxidant activity values were measured by the ORAC assay - 224.6 +/- 6.6 and 154.0 +/- 9.9 mu M TE g(-1) DW for 70 and 85% ethanol extracts, respectively. also showed that both extracts exhibited very weak antimicrobial activity against the examined microorganisms. However, the 70% ethanol extract possessed higher inhibition ability, which correlated with higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity.', 'Within this particular framework, the extracts obtained from Inula sarana using a variety of solvents, included n-hexane, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane (DCM), 70% ethanol, ethanol, and water. The extracts obtained from n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and DCM were then subjected to a specific method for their incorporation into beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). The establishment of complex formation was validated through the utilization of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The identification of phytochemical components was executed using UHPLC-HRMS. Furthermore, the total phenolic and flavonoid content was evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and the AlCl3 method. Subsequently, the determination of antioxidant capacity was conducted utilizing DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC, Frap, PBD, and MCA assays. The enzyme inhibitory activities of the samples (extracts and beta-CD complexes) were also examined by AChE, BChE, tyrosinase, alpha-glucosidase, and alpha-amylase. The findings indicated that water and 70% ethanol extracts contained the highest phenolic content. One hundred and fourteen bioactive compounds were identified by UHPLC-HRMS analysis. This study unveiled a substantial array of flavonoids, phenolic acid-hexosides and caffeoylhexaric acids within I. sarana, marking their initial identification in this context. Among the various extracts tested, the 70% ethanol extract stood out due to its high flavonoid content (jaceosidin, cirsiliol, and eupatilin) and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acid hexosides. This extract also displayed notably enhanced antioxidant activity, with ABTS, CUPRAC, and FRAP test values of 106.50 mg TE/g dry extract, 224.31 mg TE/g dry extract, and 110.40 mg TE/g, respectively. However, the antioxidant values of the complex extracts with beta-CD were generally lower than those of the pure extracts, an observation warranting significant consideration. In terms of enzyme inhibition activity, the ethanol and 70% ethanol extracts exhibited higher inhibitory effects on AChE, tyrosinase, and alpha-glucosidase. Conversely, n-hexane displayed stronger inhibitory activity against BChE. The ethyl acetate extract demonstrated elevated amylase inhibitory activity. However, the antioxidant values of the complex extracts with beta-CD were generally lower than those of the pure extracts, a noteworthy observation, while water and extracts from the I. sarana complex with beta-CD exhibited minimal or negatable inhibitory activity against specific enzymes.', 'The present study examined the physicochemical, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of three medicinal plants: thyme (Thymus callieri Borbas ex Velen), cotton thistle (Onopordum acanthium L.), and hawthorn fruit (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) from the Western Rhodope Mountains, Bulgaria. The first stage determined the physicochemical characteristics (moisture, ash, carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamin C) of the three herbs. The second stage investigated four types of extracts (aqueous, oil, methanolic, and ethanolic) of each herb and evaluated their total phenolic content, the presence of phenolic compounds (flavonoids and phenolic acids), their antioxidant activity, and antimicrobial properties. Thyme was characterised by the highest ash, protein, and vitamin C content (6.62%, 11.30%, and 571 mg/100 g, respectively). Hawthorn fruit showed the highest moisture and carbohydrate content (8.50% and 4.20%, respectively). The 70% ethanolic extracts of the three herbs exhibited the highest levels of phenolic compounds and, consequently, pronounced antioxidant activity, compared to the other three types of extracts. The aqueous, oil, methanolic, and ethanolic thyme extracts demonstrated the highest total phenolic content-TPC (27.20 mg GAE/g, 8.20 mg GAE/g, 31.70 mg GAE/g, and 310.00 mg GAE/g, respectively), compared to the extracts of the other two plants. These results were consistent with the highest antioxidant activity of the thyme extracts determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and the hydroxyl radical averting capacity (HORAC) assay (except for the oil extract examined using the DPPH method). The results from the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that the flavonoid quercetin-3-ss-glucoside had the highest concentration in thyme (374.5 mg/100 g), while myricetin dominated in the cotton thistle (152.3 mg/100 g). The phenolic acid content analysis showed prevalence of rosmaric acid in the thyme (995 mg/100 g), whereas chlorogenic acid was detected in the highest concentration in the cotton thistle and hawthorn fruit (324 mg/100 g and 27.7 mg/100 g, respectively). The aqueous, methanolic, and ethanolic extracts showed moderate to high antibacterial potential but limited antifungal activity. None of the oil extracts inhibited the test microorganisms used in the study.']"

The study examined COVID-19 immunisation coverage, behaviours, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines among students in Bulgarian medical universities. A prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken in September 2021- January 2022. Demographics, university programme, year of study, general vaccine attitudes and behaviour, and personal experience with COVID-19 and vaccines were collected. The chi-square test was used to test for associations and binominal logistic regression to identify possible predictors for vaccination. A total of 3050 students with a median age of 22 years, predominantly female participated. Three-quarters of the students (73.5%) have been vaccinated against COVID-19. An association was found between COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination in the previous season (chi 2 = 67.15, p < 0.001) as well as the intention to receive the flu vaccine in the current season (chi 2 = 142.83, p < 0.001). Vaccine hesitation mainly stemmed from fear of side effects and safety concerns, but non-vaccinated students voiced them more often. Respondents who were less likely to be vaccinated considered themselves to have: (a) limited access to sufficient information to allow them to make an informed decision to vaccinate against COVID-19; (b) lack of public awareness and education campaigns about COVID-19 vaccines; (c) insufficient information about COVID-19 vaccines during university education that would allow them to make an informed decision to vaccinate; and (d) had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.

Several studies have elucidated the role of risk factors in the prognosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the progression of COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review assesses the link between COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk factors, and investigates the prognosis in the case of myocardial injury.  A literature search was performed to identify relevant articles in Pubmed, MEDLINE, Elsevier, and Google Scholar the last two years using the terms: COVID-19, CVD, risk factors, cardiovascular risk factors, SARS-CoV-2, lockdown, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Exclusion criteria were the studies associated with pediatric and pregnant COVID-19 patients.  After screening through 3071 articles, 10 studies were included in this review that captured the findings from 3912 participants. Included studies found that preexisting CVD was linked to worse outcomes and increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 itself also induced myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and venous thromboembolism.  Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity were associated with intensive care unit admission and poor prognosis. Cardiovascular risk factors are crucial for the progression of COVID-19, and infected patients should be constantly monitored and follow strict hygiene and decrease their social interactions.', 'The entire world has been suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since March 11, 2020.

In addition, we discuss challenges associated with the COVID-19 vaccination, such as the global access and distribution of vaccine doses, adherence to hygiene guidelines after vaccination, the emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, and vaccine resistance. Despite all these challenges and the fact that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unclear, vaccines have brought great hope for the world, with several reports indicating a significant decline in the risk of COVID19-related infection and hospitalizations.']"

A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2021 to May 2024. The survey included 257 GBS isolates from Bulgarian inpatients and outpatients with streptococcal infections. Antibiotic resistance genes and capsular serotypes were detected and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We classified GBS isolates into groups according to their source as vaginal samples (191) and extra-vaginal samples (66), subdivided as invasive (36) and non-invasive specimens (30). The most common serotypes were Ia (26.5%), III (20.2%), and V (19.8%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all examined isolates were susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracyclines was observed in 60.3%, 24.9%, and 89.1% of the isolates.

Carbapenemases, two component system phoQ/phoP, pmrA/B, and mgrB were investigated by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Among 37 colistin nonsusceptible isolates, we detected 25 NDM-1 producers. The isolates belonged mainly to ST11 (80%), and also to ST147, ST35, ST340, ST219 (1-2 members per clone). Nine colistin resistant isolates showed changes in mgrB. IS903B-like elements truncated mgrB in five isolates. In two isolates, premature stopcodon (Q30stopcodon) was observed and another two isolates did not amplify mgrB, possibly due to bigger deletion or insertion. No isolates showed phoQ/phoP and pmrA/B mutations except for pmrB (four isolates had R256G). All isolates with IS903B insertions belonged to ST11 clone. The mgrB alterations play major role in colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates studied in the current work.

This was a multinational, double-blind, parallel-group study in patients with active AS. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P13 (5 mg/kg) or RP (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 8 weeks up to week 54. To assess responses, standardized assessment tools were used with an intention-to-treat analysis of observed data. Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), PK parameters, and safety outcomes were also assessed.  Of 250 randomized patients (n = 125 per group), 210 (84.0 %) completed 54 weeks of treatment, with similar completion rates between groups. At week 54, Assessment of Spondylo Arthritis international Society (ASAS) 20 response, ASAS40 response and ASAS partial remission were comparable between treatment groups. Changes from baseline in PROs such as mean Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI; CT-P13 -3.1 versus RP -2.8), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI; -2.9 versus -2.7), and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores (9.26 versus 10.13 for physical component summary; 7.30 versus 6.54 for mental component summary) were similar between treatment groups. At 54 weeks, 19.5 % and 23.0 % of patients receiving CT-P13 and RP, respectively, had ADAs. All observed PK parameters of CT-P13 and RP, including maximum and minimum serum concentrations, were similar through 54 weeks. The influence of ADAs on PK was similar in the two treatment groups. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. There was no notable difference between treatment groups in the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, infections and infusion-related reactions.  CT-P13 and RP have highly comparable efficacy (including PROs) and PK up to week 54. Over a 1-year period, CT-P13 was well tolerated and displayed a safety profile comparable to RP; no differences in immunogenicity were observed.', 'The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical properties of the skin in psoriatic plaques before and after treatment with dithranol and in clinically uninvolved psoriatic skin in comparison with the skin of healthy controls. In total, 82 psoriatic plaques in 19 in-patients and 51 age-matched control subjects were studied with a non-invasive suction device (Cotometer), The plaques were characterized by statistically significant lower skin distensibility and elasticity, and a higher viscoelastic to elastic ratio compared with adjacent apparently normal skin. Delayed distension and hysteresis measured using a 2-mm diameter probe were decreased, but were increased when measured by a 8-mm diameter probe. These differences can be explained by the increased skin thickness in psoriasis and by the different aspects of skin mechanics determined by the 2 measuring probes. After treatment, the mechanical parameters of psoriatic plaques approached the values of adjacent control skin. The uninvolved volar forearm skin in psoriatic patients (2-mm diameter probe) showed statistically significant lower values of skin distensibility and higher values of viscoelasticity parameters compared with the skin of healthy control subjects. This suggests that the normal-appearing psoriatic skin is not entirely normal. The non-invasive method applied can be used for objective and quantitative evaluation of the effect of therapy in patients with psoriasis.', 'CT-P13 (Remsima (R), Inflectra (R)) is a biosimilar of the infliximab reference product (RP; Remicade (R)).

In this multinational phase III double-blind study, patients with active RA and an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P13 (3 mg/kg) or RP (3 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 8 weeks to week 54 in combination with MTX (12.5-25 mg/week). Efficacy endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response rates, patient-reported outcomes and joint damage progression. Immunogenicity, safety and PK/PD outcomes were also assessed.  Of 606 randomized patients, 455 (CT-P13 233, RP 222) were treated up to week 54. At week 54, ACR20 response rate was highly similar between groups (CT-P13 74.7 %, RP 71.3 %). ACR50 and ACR70 response rates were also comparable between groups (CT-P13 43.6 % and 21.3 %, respectively; RP 43.1 % and 19.9 %, respectively). DAS28, SDAI and CDAI decreased from baseline to week 54 to a similar extent with CT-P13 and RP. Radiographic progression measured by Sharp scores as modified by van der Heijde was also comparable. With both treatments, patient assessments of pain, disease activity and physical ability, as well as mean scores on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), improved markedly at week 14 and remained stable thereafter up to week 54. The proportion of patients positive for antidrug antibodies at week 54 was similar between the two groups: 41.1 % and 36.0 % with CT-P13 and RP, respectively. CT-P13 was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile to RP. PK/PD results were also comparable between CT-P13 and RP.  CT-P13 and RP were comparable in terms of efficacy (including radiographic progression), immunogenicity and PK/PD up to week 54. The safety profile of CT-P13 was also similar to that of RP.']"

These lesions are usually asymptomatic. A main pancreatic duct IPMN is usually symptomatic and may present as an emergency when occlusion of the common bile duct with thick mucinous secretion and jaundice develop. This complication is hard to manage pharmacotherapeutically or by endoscopic procedure and may require surgical treatment.  This is a case report of a complicated main pancreatic duct IPMN that required an urgent, two-stage operation. A review of the literature on the topic was carried out. Case description: A 67-year-old male patient with symptoms of jaundice was diagnosed with acute cholangitis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis as complications of the mucinous obstruction of the main pancreatic duct and of the common bile duct (CBD) caused by IPMN. The condition was confirmed by cholangio-pancreatoscopy and biopsy. Stenting of CBD was attempted, but the procedure turned out unsuccessful, and we proceeded to an emergency two-stage operation. The first operation consisted of the clearance of the bile ducts from infected mucinous secretion, cholecystectomy, and hepatico-jejunostomy. A Whipple procedure was performed as a second-stage operation. Discussion: Cases of emergency are not common in patients with IPMN. However, obstructive jaundice by mucinous secretion due to the disease is hard to treat only by endoscopy because of the high risk of obstruction of the endoprosthesis. On the other hand, emergency pancreatic resections are associated with a high risk of perioperative complications.  Sometimes, the complicated main pancreatic duct IPMNs can pose a challenge for the interdisciplinary team of invasive gastroenterologists and surgeons, and the key to a successful outcome is surgical interventions in two-or three stages that include complications management as the first stage, followed by surgical resection as a second stage operation. Biliary drainage improvement is usually only temporarily successful with the insertion of biliary stents because of the rapid mucinous occlusion and the remaining risk of cholangitis and cholecystitis.', ""Obstruction and perforation due to colorectal cancer represent challenging matters in terms of diagnosis, life-saving strategies, obstruction resolution and oncologic challenge. The aims of the current paper are to update the previous WSES guidelines for the management of large bowel perforation and obstructive left colon carcinoma (OLCC) and to develop new guidelines on obstructive right colon carcinoma (ORCC).  The literature was extensively queried for focused publication until December 2017. Precise analysis and grading of the literature has been performed by a working group formed by a pool of experts: the statements and literature review were presented, discussed and voted at the Consensus Conference of the 4th Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) held in Campinas in May 2017.  CT scan is the best imaging technique to evaluate large bowel obstruction and perforation. For OLCC, selfexpandable metallic stent (SEMS), when available, offers interesting advantages as compared to emergency surgery; however, the positioning of SEMS for surgically treatable causes carries some long-term oncologic disadvantages, which are still under analysis. In the context of emergency surgery, resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) is preferable to Hartmann's procedure, whenever the characteristics of the patient and the surgeon are permissive. Rightsided loop colostomy is preferable in rectal cancer, when preoperative therapies are predicted. With regards to the treatment of ORCC, right colectomy represents the procedure of choice; alternatives, such as internal bypass and loop ileostomy, are of limited value. Clinical scenarios in the case of perforation might be dramatic, especially in case of free faecal peritonitis. The importance of an appropriate balance between life-saving surgical procedures and respect of oncologic caveats must be stressed. In selected cases, a damage control approach may be required. Medical treatments including appropriate fluid resuscitation, early antibiotic treatment and management of co-existing medical conditions according to international guidelines must be delivered to all patients at presentation.  The current guidelines offer an extensive overview of available evidence and a qualitative consensus regarding management of large bowel obstruction and perforation due to colorectal cancer."", 'BackgroundLaparoscopy is widely adopted across nearly all surgical subspecialties in the elective setting. Initially finding indication in minor abdominal emergencies, it has gradually become the standard approach in the majority of elective general surgery procedures. Despite many technological advances and increasing acceptance, the laparoscopic approach remains underutilized in emergency general surgery and in abdominal trauma. Emergency laparotomy continues to carry a high morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been a growing interest from emergency and trauma surgeons in adopting minimally invasive surgery approaches in the acute surgical setting. The present position paper, supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), aims to provide a review of the literature to reach a consensus on the indications and benefits of a laparoscopic-first approach in patients requiring emergency abdominal surgery for general surgery emergencies or abdominal trauma.MethodsThis position paper was developed according to the WSES methodology. A steering committee performed the literature review and drafted the position paper. An international panel of 54 experts then critically revised the manuscript and discussed it in detail, to develop a consensus on a position statement.ResultsA total of 323 studies (systematic review and meta-analysis, randomized clinical trial, retrospective comparative cohort studies, case series) have been selected from an initial pool of 7409 studies. Evidence demonstrates several benefits of the laparoscopic approach in stable patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery for general surgical emergencies or abdominal trauma. The selection of a stable patient seems to be of paramount importance for a safe adoption of a laparoscopic approach. In hemodynamically stable patients, the laparoscopic approach was found to be safe, feasible and effective as a therapeutic tool or helpful to identify further management steps and needs, resulting in improved outcomes, regardless of conversion. Appropriate patient selection, surgeon experience and rigorous minimally invasive surgical training, remain crucial factors to increase the adoption of laparoscopy in emergency general surgery and abdominal trauma.ConclusionsThe WSES expert panel suggests laparoscopy as the first approach for stable patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery for general surgery emergencies and abdominal trauma.']"

It describes the epidemiology of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2014 within 35 countries.  In 2016, the ERA-EDTA Registry received data on patients who in 2014 where undergoing RRT for ESRD, from 51 national or regional renal registries. Thirty-two registries provided individual patient level data and 19 provided aggregated patient level data. The incidence, prevalence and survival probabilities of these patients were determined.  In 2014, 70 953 individuals commenced RRT for ESRD, equating to an overall unadjusted incidence rate of 133 per million population (pmp). The incidence ranged by 10-fold; from 23 pmp in the Ukraine to 237 pmp in Portugal. Of the patients commencing RRT, almost two-thirds were men, over half were aged >= 65 years and a quarter had diabetes mellitus as their primary renal diagnosis. By day 91 of commencing RRT, 81% of patients were receiving haemodialysis. On 31 December 2014, 490 743 individuals were receiving RRT for ESRD, equating to an unadjusted prevalence of 924 pmp. This ranged throughout Europe by more than 10-fold, from 157 pmp in the Ukraine to 1794 pmp in Portugal. In 2014, 19 406 kidney transplantations were performed, equating to an overall unadjusted transplant rate of 36 pmp. Again this varied considerably throughout Europe. For patients commencing RRT during 2005-09, the 5-year-adjusted patient survival probabilities on all RRT modalities was 63.3% (95% confidence interval 63.0-63.6). The expected remaining lifetime of a 20-to 24-year-old patient with ESRD receiving dialysis or living with a kidney transplant was 21.9 and 44.0 years, respectively. This was substantially lower than the 61.8 years of expected remaining lifetime of a 20-year-old patient without ESRD."", 'Regarding COVID-19 infection, Bulgaria has one of the lowest rates of vaccination in Europe, and its COVID-19-related mortality rate has been one of the highest in the European Union. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after hospital admission. This single-center prospective cohort study from Bulgaria included 120 in-patient COVID-19 subjects of whom 70 had CKD and 50 normal renal function. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease were statistically more prevalent in the CKD group as compared to the non-CKD group. At admission, D-dimer, creatinine, and urea levels were significantly higher in the CKD group, whereas estimated glomerular-filtration rate was significantly lower as compared to the non-CKD patients. During hospitalization, 23 patients (19.1%) died, of which 19 were in the CKD group (p-value = 0.0096); in addition, 38 developed AKI (31.6%), of which 31 were in the CKD group (p-value = 0.0006). Using binary logistic regression, being male, having experienced AKI, and not having been treated with remdesivir were independent risk factors for COVID-19-induced mortality. Regarding risk of AKI, having had COVID-19-related symptoms for more than 6 days before admission, having CKD at baseline, and having not received remdesivir therapy were independent predictive factors for developing AKI after admission.', 'The European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Registry collects data on kidney replacement therapy (KRT) via national and regional renal registries in Europe and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

Individual patient data on patients undergoing KRT in 2018 were provided by 34 national or regional renal registries and aggregated data by 17 registries. The incidence and prevalence of KRT, the kidney transplantation activity and the survival probabilities of these patients were calculated.  In 2018, the ERA-EDTA Registry covered a general population of 636 million people. Overall, the incidence of KRT for kidney failure was 129 per million population (p.m.p.), 62% of patients were men, 51% were >= 65years of age and 20% had diabetes mellitus as cause of kidney failure. Treatment modality at the onset of KRT was haemodialysis (HD) for 84%, peritoneal dialysis (PD) for 11% and pre-emptive kidney transplantation for 5% of patients. On 31 December 2018, the prevalence of KRT was 897 p.m.p., with 57% of patients on HD, 5% on PD and 38% living with a kidney transplant. The transplant rate in 2018 was 35 p.m.p.: 68% received a kidney from a deceased donor, 30% from a living donor and for 2% the donor source was unknown. For patients commencing dialysis during 2009-13, the unadjusted 5-year survival probability was 42.6%. For patients receiving a kidney transplant within this period, the unadjusted 5-year survival probability was 86.6% for recipients of deceased donor grafts and 93.9% for recipients of living donor grafts.']"

Using sequence data from two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes and applying several phylogenetic methods and species delimitation approaches to an extensive dataset, we have reconstructed the phylogeny of the Podarcis wall lizards in the Balkans, and re-investigated the taxonomic status of the P. tauricus species subgroup. Multilocus analyses revealed that the aforementioned subgroup consists of five major clades, with P. melisellensis as its most basal taxon. Monophyly of P. tauricus sensu stricto is not supported, with one of the subspecies (P. t. ionicus) displaying great genetic diversity (hidden diversity or cryptic species). It comprises five, geographically distinct, subclades with genetic distances on the species level. Species delimitation approaches revealed nine species within the P. tauricus species subgroup (P. melisellensis, P. gaigeae, P. milensis, and six in the P. tauricus complex), underlining the necessity of taxonomic re-evaluation. We thus synonymize some previously recognized subspecies in this subgroup, elevate P. t. tauricus and P. g. gaigeae to the species level and suggest a distinct Albanian-Greek Glade, provisionally named as the P. ionicus species complex. The latter Glade comprises five unconfirmed candidate species that call for comprehensive studies in the future.', ""The digenean species of Echinostoma (Echinostomatidae) with 37 collar spines that comprise the so-called 'revolutum' species complex, qualify as cryptic due to the interspecific homogeneity of characters used to differentiate species. Only five species were considered valid in the most recent revision of the group but recent molecular studies have demonstrated a higher diversity within the group. In a study of the digeneans parasitising molluscs in central and northern Europe we found that Radix auricularia, R. peregra and Stagnicola palustris were infected with larval stages of two cryptic species of the 'revolutum' complex, one resembling E. revolutum and one undescribed species, Echinostoma sp. IG. This paper provides morphological and molecular evidence for their delimitation.  Totals of 2,030 R. auricularia, 357 R. peregra and 577 S. palustris were collected in seven reservoirs of the River Ruhr catchment area in Germany and a total of 573 R. peregra was collected in five lakes in Iceland. Cercariae were examined and identified live and fixed in molecular grade ethanol for DNA isolation and in hot/cold 4% formaldehyde solution for obtaining measurements from fixed materials. Partial fragments of the mitochondrial gene nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) were amplified for 14 isolates.  Detailed examination of cercarial morphology allowed us to differentiate the cercariae of the two Echinostoma spp. of the 'revolutum' species complex. A total of 14 partial nad1 sequences was generated and aligned with selected published sequences for eight species of the 'revolutum' species complex. Both NJ and BI analyses resulted in consensus trees with similar topologies in which the isolates from Europe formed strongly supported reciprocally monophyletic lineages. The analyses also provided evidence that North American isolates identified as E. revolutum represent another cryptic species of the 'revolutum' species complex.

Diplostomum and Tylodelphys spp. are broadly distributed, commonly reported, and the most often sequenced diplostomid genera. The majority of published DNA sequences from these genera originated from larval stages only, which typically cannot be identified to the species level based on morphology alone. We generated partial large ribosomal subunit (28S) rRNA and cytochrome c oxi-dase subunit 1 (cox1) mtDNA gene sequences from 14 species/species-level lineages of Diplostomum, six species/species-level lineages of Tylodelphys, two species/species-level lineages of Austrodiplostomum, one species previously assigned to Paralaria, two species/species-level lineages of Dolichorchis and one unknown diplostomid. Our DNA sequences of 11 species/species-level lineages of Diplostomum (all identified to species), four species/species-level lineages of Tylodelphys (all identified to species), Austrodiplostomum compactum, Paralaria alarioides and Dolichorchis lacombeensis originated from adult specimens. 28S sequences were used for phylogenetic inference to demonstrate the position of Paralaria alarioides and Dolichorchis spp. within the Diplostomoidea and study the interrelationships of Diplostomum, Tylodelphys and Austrodiplostomum. Our results demonstrate that two diplostomids from the North American river otter (P. alarioides and a likely undescribed taxon) belong within Diplostomum. Further, our results demonstrate the non-monophyly of Tylodelphys due to the position of Austrodiplostomum spp., based on our phylogenetic analyses and morphology. Furthermore, the results of phylogenetic analysis of 28S confirmed the status of Dolichorchis as a separate genus. The phylogenies suggest multiple definitive host-switching events (birds to otters and among major avian groups) and a New World origin of Diplostomum and Tylodelphys spp. Our DNA sequences from adult digeneans revealed identities of 10 previously published lineages of Diplostomum and Tylodelphys, which were pre-viously identified to genus only. The novel DNA data from this work provide opportunities for future comparisons of larval diplostomines collected in ecological studies. (c) 2021 Australian Society for Parasitology.

Paraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms remain a major challenge for vascular neurosurgeons. There are still controversies in the management of carotid artery (CA) dissections. Surgical and endovascular treatment is recommended in cases with multivessel dissections or those complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 35-year-old woman presenting clinical manifestations and tomographic findings compatible with SAH caused by rupture of a paraclinoid aneurysm in the left ICA. We had to treat the ruptured aneurysm and the concurrent dissection of both ICAs. The patient underwent high-flow extracranial-intracranial arterial graft bypass and subsequent trapping of the left ICA. Complete aneurysm exclusion from the cerebral circulation was achieved, and the possible embolic events from the left side were prevented. The concomitant right internal CAD was treated conservatively with anticoagulants and antiplatelets.  Dealing only with the ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm, without taking care of the underlying cerebral ischemia owing to concomitant extracranial ICA dissection, could be an insufficient approach for treatment. In the presented case of a giant ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm and coexistence of severe bilateral ICA dissecting stenosis, trapping with matching the bypass flow was the proper solution for managing simultaneously with the aneurysm and the cerebral ischemia from the left side. Anticoagulants and antiplatelets were applied safely to treat the right internal CAD.', 'Wide-necked cerebral aneurysms in the setting of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remain difficult to treat with endovascular methods despite recent progress in the neuroendovascular field.  To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Comaneci device (Rapid Medical, Israel) in endovascular coil embolization of acutely ruptured, wide-necked sidewall, or bifurcation cerebral aneurysms.  We retrospectively reviewed 45 anterior communicating artery, 24 internal carotid artery, 21 middle cerebral artery bifurcation, 15 anterior cerebral artery, and 13 posterior circulation aneurysms, which were treated using Comaneci-assisted coil embolization from August 2017 to January 2019. We evaluated procedural complications, clinical outcomes, and mid-term angiographic follow-up. Immediate and 90 d-clinical outcome and radiological follow-up were obtained in all patients.  Comaneci-assisted coil embolization was performed in 118 acutely ruptured aneurysms. The technique was carried out successfully in all cases. Simultaneous application of 2 separated Comaneci devices was performed in 8/118 cases (6.77%). Periprocedural thromboembolic complications related to the device were seen in 7/118 cases (5.93%) and severe vasospasm of the parent artery after manipulation of the Comaneci device occurred in 5/118 cases (4.2%). The procedural-related morbidity rate was 2.54%, and there was no procedural related mortality. Among the available survivors, angiographic followups were obtained at 3 and 6 mo, and complete aneurysmal obliteration was confirmed in 81/112 (72.3%) and 75/112 (66.9%) cases, respectively. Mid-term follow-up reviewed total recanalization rate of 14.28%.  Comaneci-assisted embolization of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms in patients presenting with acute SAH is associated with high procedural safety and adequate occlusion rates. Furthermore, dual antiplatelet therapy can be safely avoided in this patient group.', 'Formation of local type aortic aneurysm years after surgical repair of coarctation (CoA) occurs in 10% of patients independent of the surgical technique and is a potentially life-threatening condition if left untreated with a high risk of aortic rupture. Redo open surgery is associated with 14% in-hospital mortality and a high risk of complications. Endovascular treatment appears to be a feasible alternative with a high success rate and low morbidity and mortality, but data concerning long-term results is still mandatory. We describe the single center experience of a series of patients treated with endovascular stent grafting for large aneurysms after previous surgery for CoA.This series involves 12 consecutive patients treated with endovascular stent grafting from April 2003 to January 2022 for late aneurysm at the site of previous surgical repair for CoA. Data on baseline characteristics, clinical, computed tomography (CT), procedural features, and in-hospital and long-term results were analyzed. All patients signed institutional informed consent for the procedure.A total of 12 patients (average age 38.5 +/- 10.2 years) underwent endovascular repair. The average interval between the initial surgical intervention and the aneurysm repair was 24.1 +/- 9.1 years and the majority (83.3%) underwent synthetic patch aortoplasty as previous intervention. All patients were symptomatic at presentation with an average maximum diameter of the aneurysm 67.2 mm (ranging from 44 to 110 mm). Stent-graft placement was successful in all cases without procedural, in-hospital, 30-day, and one-year mortality or major complications. The average hospital stay was 9.3 days (range 7-19 days). For a mean follow-up period of 87 months (range, 23-168 months), all patients demonstrated positive aneurysm remodeling with cavity thrombosis and aneurysm diameter reduction to 54.9 mm (+/- 16,6). For the entire follow-up period, we observed one aneurysm-related death and three deaths of heart failure.Endovascular stent-graft treatment of patients with thoracic aneurysms after repair of CoA is an acceptable treatment of choice. It has shown promising results with high technical success and low immediate, short-and mid-term morbidity and mortality. Still, randomised control trials (RCTs) are needed to define the long-term outcome of this approach. Routine surveillance and screening of patients with previous CoA repair are mandatory.']"

The nanosized fluorescent micellar systems were embedded with a novel anticancer drug via the self-assembling behavior of well-defined block copolymers based on amphiphilic poly(acrylic acid)-block-poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PAA-b-PnBA) copolymer obtained by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) and hydrophobic anticancer benzimidazole-hydrazone drug (BzH). Through this method, well-defined nanosized fluorescent micelles were obtained consisting of a hydrophilic PAA shell and a hydrophobic PnBA core embedded with the BzH drug due to the hydrophobic interactions, thus reaching very high encapsulation efficiency. The size, morphology, and fluorescent properties of blank and drug-loaded micelles were investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fluorescent spectroscopy, respectively. Additionally, after 72 h of incubation, drug-loaded micelles released 3.25 & mu;M of BzH, which was spectrophotometrically determined. The BzH drug-loaded micelles were found to exhibit enhanced antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB-231 cells, with long-lasting effects on microtubule organization, with apoptotic alterations and preferential localization in the perinuclear space of cancer cells. In contrast, the antitumor effect of BzH alone or incorporated in micelles on non-cancerous cells MCF-10A was relatively weak.', 'The synergistic effect of drug and gene delivery is expected to significantly improve cancer therapy. However, it is still challenging to design suitable nanocarriers that are able to load simultaneously anticancer drugs and nucleic acids due to their different physico-chemical properties.

Four batches of drug-loaded formulations were developed at varied drug-polymer ratios using a simple coacervation technique followed by spray-drying. They were further characterized using scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD diffractometry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Drug release was investigated in different media (pH 5 and 7.4). The cytotoxicity of the daunorubicin-loaded nanoparticles was compared to that of the pure drug. The influence of the polymer-to-drug ratio on the nanoparticles' properties such as their particle size, surface morphology, production yield, drug loading, entrapment efficiency, and drug release behavior was studied.

HEV is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are estimated 20 million HEV infections worldwide every year, leading to estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of HEV infection. The WHO estimates that HEV infection caused approximately 44,000 deaths in 2015, which represents 3.3% of mortality rates due to viral hepatitis. In low-income (LI) countries and lowermiddle-income (LMI) countries, HEV is a waterborne infection induced by HEV genotype (gt) 1 and HEV gt 2 that cause large outbreaks and affect young individuals with a high mortality rate in pregnant women from South Asian countries and patients with liver diseases. HEV gt 3, HEV gt 4, and HEV gt 7 are responsible for sporadic infections with zoonotic transmission mainly through the consumption of raw or undercooked meat from different animals. Acute HEV infection is relatively asymptomatic or mild clinical form, in rare cases the disease can be moderate/severe clinical forms and result in fulminant hepatitis or acute liver failure (ALF). Furthermore, HEV infection is associated with extrahepatic manifestations, including renal and neurological clinical signs and symptoms. Pregnant women, infants, older people, immunocompromised individuals, patients with comorbidities, and workers who come into close contact with HEV-infected animals are recognized as major risk groups for severe clinical form of HEV infection and fatal outcome. Chronic HEV infection can occur in immunocompromised individuals with the possibility of progression to cirrhosis.', 'Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic disease. Over the past decade, CCHF cases in humans have emerged in Turkey and reemerged in the Balkan countries, Ukraine and Tajikistan. Occupational contact with infected livestock has been recognized as a common cause of the disease. A cross-sectional seroprevalence study in livestock was conducted in farming communities of an endemic area in Bulgaria, southeastern Europe. Overall, 72% of the tested animals were positive for IgG antibodies to CCHF virus. By the time the animals were one-year old almost 50% had serologic evidence of CCHF infection, and by two years already 80% of them had been infected. The data obtained in this study reflect current situation of CCHF virus infection among livestock in Bulgaria. The results showed active CCHF virus circulation that poses risk for humans to be infected during contacts with animals and requires public health awareness.', 'Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe illness characterised by fever, bleeding and high case-fatality rates. The disease is caused by CCHF virus (CCHFV), transmitted by ticks and infectious body fluids and tissues.  After CCHF was diagnosed in three persons in 2023, we aimed to investigate the presence of antibodies against CCHFV in healthcare workers (HCW), sheep and goats, and of CCHFV in ticks, in an area in North Macedonia and characterise virus strains.  In 2023, we collected blood samples from HCWs involved in treating CCHF patients and sera and ticks from sheep and goats in the village in North Macedonia where the index case resided. The blood samples were analysed by ELISA. Ticks were tested for presence of CCHFV, and the virus from a CCHF case was sequenced.  Samples from four of 52 HCWs and 10 of 17 small ruminants had antibodies against CCHFV. The virus was not detected from any of the 24 Rhipicephalus bursa ticks. The virus strain from the index case clustered with regional strains within the Europe-1 lineage (genotype V) group and was closest to strains from Kosovo  This report shows CCHFV is endemic in North Macedonia. Raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus is important. Healthcare workers need to be aware of the disease. Early detection, robust diagnostic methods, surveillance and collaborative efforts are necessary to prevent and control CCHF in the affected regions.']"

A Medline search of publications between 2000 and 2005 was conducted, with articles selected by experts. New evidence supports previous ARIA statements, such as: (i) allergic rhinitis (AR) is a risk factor for asthma; (ii) patients with persistent rhinitis should be evaluated for asthma; (iii) most patients with asthma have rhinitis; (iv) a combined strategy should be used to treat the airways and (v) in low- to middle-income countries, a different strategy may be needed. The increased risk of asthma has also been found among sufferers from non-AR. Recent reports show AR is a global problem. Many studies demonstrated parallel increasing prevalence of asthma and rhinitis, but in regions of highest prevalence, it may be reaching a plateau. Factors associated with a reduced risk of asthma and AR have been identified, confirming previous findings of protection related to exposure to infections. Treatment of rhinitis with intranasal glucocorticosteroids, antihistamines, leukotriene antagonists or immunotherapy may reduce morbidity because of asthma. To take advantage of the paradigm of unified airways, there is a need to rationalize diagnosis and treatment to optimize management.', ""Allergic rhinitis is a symptomatic disorder of the nose induced after allergen exposure by an IgE-mediated inflammation of the membranes lining the nose. It is a global health problem that causes major illness and disability worldwide. Over 600 million patients from all countries, all ethnic groups and of all ages suffer from allergic rhinitis. It affects social life, sleep, school and work and its economic impact is substantial. Risk factors for allergic rhinitis are well identified. Indoor and outdoor allergens as well as occupational agents cause rhinitis and other allergic diseases. The role of indoor and outdoor pollution is probably very important, but has yet to be fully understood both for the occurrence of the disease and its manifestations. In 1999, during the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) WHO workshop, the expert panel proposed a new classification for allergic rhinitis which was subdivided into 'intermittent' or 'persistent' disease. This classification is now validated. The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is often quite easy, but in some cases it may cause problems and many patients are still under-diagnosed, often because they do not perceive the symptoms of rhinitis as a disease impairing their social life, school and work. The management of allergic rhinitis is well established and the ARIA expert panel based its recommendations on evidence using an extensive review of the literature available up to December 1999. The statements of evidence for the development of these guidelines followed WHO rules and were based on those of Shekelle et al. A large number of papers have been published since 2000 and are extensively reviewed in the 2008 Update using the same evidence-based system. Recommendations for the management of allergic rhinitis are similar in both the ARIA workshop report and the 2008 Update. In the future, the GRADE approach will be used, but is not yet available. Another important aspect of the ARIA guidelines was to consider co-morbidities. Both allergic rhinitis and asthma are systemic inflammatory conditions and often co-exist in the same patients. In the 2008 Update, these links have been confirmed. The ARIA document is not intended to be a standard-of-care document for individual countries. It is provided as a basis for physicians, health care professionals and organizations involved in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma in various countries to facilitate the development of relevant local standard-of-care documents for patients."", ""This study aims to evaluate clinical characteristics, quality of life and control of treatment and therapy satisfaction of patients with asthma in Bulgaria. A pilot study of Bulgarian patients with asthma selected by allergologists was performed. The predefined inclusion criteria were asthma diagnosis with at least 6 months of living with asthma and use of asthma medication. Patient characteristics, treatment, quality-of-life, control of asthma and therapy satisfaction were systematically assessed. A retrospective observational study was conducted among asthma patients in Sofia in 2019. A strict definition of asthma-based solely on physicians' diagnosis was used. Allergologists from two national reference hospitals for asthma therapy selected asthma patients. Every third patient with asthma that visited the office within 5 months period, and that agreed to participate was selected for the study. Quality-of-life of patients was measured using the EQ5D Assessment Test, control of asthma was assessed using ATCQ and ATC tests. A total of 71 asthma patients were enrolled. Approximately 43.6% were male, 16.9% were smokers, occupational risk factors were low (4.22%), 25% had moderate and 38% had severe asthma. The mean scores of asthma control treatment were 16.92 +/- 5.68. The group has relatively high percentages of severe asthma patients. The asthma was not well controlled.

Consequently, there is a need for additional semen processing technique that accounts for sperm DNA status and morphology prior to ICSI. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of an additional zona pellucida adhesion-based sperm selection for obtaining sperm populations with a high percentage of normal morphology and DNA integrity as compared to native semen and routine swim-up preparation. Semen samples from 78 normozoospermic men were subjected to swim up and placed in petri dishes coated with 48 acid-solubilized zonae pellucidae. Sperm DNA fragmentation and morphology were assessed in the native semen, the swim-up samples, and the zona-adhered spermatozoa from each patient. The mean sperm DNA fragmentation of the zona-selected spermatozoa (3.5 +/- 0.7%) was significantly lower than the swim-up samples (15.3 +/- 5.2%) (P < 0.001) and native semen (24.9 +/- 7.1%) (P < 0.001). All of the samples had lower levels of DNA damage after additional selection by zona pellucida adhesion. Significantly higher percentage of sperm with normal morphology was observed after zona-adhesion selection (11.4 +/- 3.9%) when compared to the swim-up samples (8.9 +/- 4.3%) (P < 0.001) or the native semen (5.3 +/- 3.2%) (P < 0.001). In 94% of the samples, the percentage of spermatozoa with normal morphology increased after the additional zona selection. This study demonstrates that sperm selection by additional zona-adhesion technique yields a significantly higher percentage of spermatozoa with normal morphology as well as a significantly decreased level of DNA fragmentation when compared to the native semen and the swim-up-only prepared samples. Lay summary High level of DNA folding known as sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) inside each sperm and defects in the shape, size, and structure of the sperm can negatively affect assisted reproduction treatment (ART) outcomes. Consequently, there is a need for additional semen processing techniques that account for sperm quality prior to ART. Our team designed a simple technique using proteins from the coat around the egg (zona pellucida) to enhance sperm selection procedures based on natural sperm-egg interactions. Using this technique in combination with the most common techniques used in ART yields a significantly higher percentage of sperm with normal shape, size, and structure and a decreased level of DNA fragmentation. This sperm zona-selection technique would be beneficial if introduced in the ART practice to yield sperm with higher fertilization potential.', ""The objective of this study was to compare the motility, morphology, and levels of DNA fragmentation of spermatozoa subjected to conventional swim-up or cumulus matrix (CM) sperm selection. Semen samples were collected from 60 normozoospermic men at a private hospital between December 2021 and March 2022. After liquefaction, semen samples were separated into two portions - one part was subjected to conventional swim-up preparation, and the remaining spermatozoa were subjected to CM selection. The CM was obtained by mechanical isolation from healthy donor oocytes. Semen analysis and evaluation of sperm were performed according to the WHO 6th Edition Laboratory Manual and Kruger's strict criteria, respectively. Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF, %) of the two preparations was evaluated using the Halosperm G2 detection Kit (Halotech, Madrid, Spain). Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the characteristics of spermatozoa obtained by the two preparations. Spermatozoa selected by CM showed significantly better rapidly progressive motility (43.5% vs 30.6%, respectively, P < 0.001), a higher percentage of morphologically normal forms (14.0% vs 9.0%, respectively, P < 0.05), and lower levels of SDF (26.0% vs 45.0%, P < 0.05) compared to those prepared by conventional swim-up. Moreover, the incidence of multiple sperm defects was considerably lower in the samples that underwent CM selection compared to those that did not (30.0% vs 49.0%, respectively, P < 0.05).The selection by CM significantly increases sperm motility and reduces morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and DNA fragmentation rates compared to the conventional swim-up preparation. The application of this selection technique may increase the chances of successful IVF outcomes. There are various techniques for selecting high-quality sperm with better shape, mobility, and DNA quality. However, the success of assisted reproduction techniques remains relatively unchanged. In this study, we describe an innovative method that uses the ingredients of a natural coat surrounding the egg (cumulus matrix) to enhance sperm selection procedures. Using this cumulus matrix as a barrier through which sperm cells pass, we mimic natural sperm-egg interactions and are able to select sperm with better characteristics compared to conventional methods. This new sperm selection procedure could lead to increased assisted reproduction success rates."", 'Sperm abnormalities may negatively affect embryo development. To determine the influence of sperm abnormalities (morphology, motility, DNA fragmentation) on embryo morphokinetic variables and clinical outcome of conventional IVF. Materials and methods Participants were 86 couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Sperm morphology was evaluated according to the strict criteria proposed by Kruger/Tygerberg. CASA system was applied for sperm motility assessment. Sperm DNA fragmentation was assessed by the chromatin structure assay (SCSA). Morphokinetic parameters were determined in 223 embryos obtained from conventional IVF only and cultured in a single-step medium using time-lapse imaging technology. Time-lapse variables from the initial embryo development, such as time of pronuclei fading (tPNf) and time for two cells (t2), were those more strongly related with abnormalities of sperm motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation. Sperm morphological abnormalities rather than sperm motility were more closely associated with embryo morphokinetics. Sperm head defects were mainly correlated with the last stages of embryonic development (t9 to tHB), sperm midpiece defects with intermediate cleaving embryos (t5-t9), and sperm tail defects with the initial stages of embryonic development (tPNa-t4). Excess residual cytoplasm was positively correlated with all embryo morphokinetic parameters except t2 and tM. Absence of acrosomes, pinheads, coiled tails, and multiple sperm morphological defects correlated negatively with time-lapse embryo morphokinetic variables. Discussion A large number of sperm-related variables, including frequency of specific morphological defects, morphological indexes, DNA fragmentation and motility, and time-lapse embryo variables, such as time intervals based mainly of 15 time points were recorded. There were strong associations between specific sperm defects of the head, midpiece, and tail with certain stages of embryonic development from observation of pronuclei to the hatched blastocyst. Coiled tail, cumulative head defects, and multiple abnormalities index (MAI) were associated both with embryo morphokinetics and the implantation success.']"

A questionnaire-based survey was performed in the period from November 2016 to March 2017 among experts involved in reimbursement matters from CEE countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. A review of requirements for reimbursement and implications of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) was performed to compare the issues in above-mentioned countries. For each specified country, data for reimbursement costs, total pharmaceutical budget, and total public health care budget in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected. Questionnaires were distributed via emails and feedback data were obtained in the same way. Additional questions, if any, were also submitted to respondents by email. Pricing and reimbursement data were valid for March 2017.  The survey revealed that the relation of drug reimbursement costs to total public healthcare spending ranged from 0.12 to 0.21 in the year 2014 and 2015 (median value). It also revealed that pricing criteria for drugs, employed in the CEE countries, were quite similar. External reference pricing as well as internal reference pricing were common in mentioned countries. Positive reimbursement lists were valid in all countries of the CEE region, negative ones were rarely used; reimbursement decisions were regularly revised and updated in themajority of countries. Copayment was common and available levels of reimbursement differed within and between the countries and ranged from 20 to 100%. Risk-sharing schemes were often in use, especially in the case of innovative, expensive drugs. Generic substitution was also possible in all analyzed CEE countries, while some made it mandatory. HTA was carried out in almost all of the considered CEE countries and HTA dossier was obligatory for submitting a pricing and reimbursement application.  Pricing and reimbursement requirements are quite similar in the CEE region although some differences were identified. HTA evaluations are commonly used in considered countries.', 'The aim of this study was to review the requirements for the reimbursement of biosimilars and to compare the reimbursement status, market share, and reimbursement costs of biosimilars in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.  A questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from the following CEE countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The requirements for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilars were reviewed for each country. Data on the extent of reimbursement of biologic drugs (separately for original products and biosimilars) in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected for each country, along with data on the total pharmaceutical and total public health care budgets.  Our survey revealed that no specific criteria were applied for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilars in the selected CEE countries; the price of biosimilars was usually reduced compared with original drugs and specific price discounts were common. Substitution and interchangeability were generally allowed, although in most countries they were at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment. Original biologic drugs and the corresponding biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed. The reimbursement rate of biosimilars in the majority of the countries was the same and amounted to 100%. Generally, the higher shares of expenditures were shown for the reimbursement of original drugs than for biosimilars, except for filgrastim, somatropin, and epoetin (alfa and zeta). The shares of expenditures on the reimbursement of biosimilar products ranged from 8.0% in Estonia in 2014 to 32.4% in Lithuania in 2015, and generally increased in 2015. The share of expenditures on reimbursement of biosimilars in the total pharmaceutical budget differed between the countries, with the highest observed value for Slovakia and Hungary and the lowest-for Croatia.  The requirements for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilar products as well as the access of patients to biologic treatment do not differ significantly between the considered CEE countries. Biosimilar drugs significantly influence the reimbursement systems of these countries, and the expenditure on the reimbursement of biosimilars is increasing as they are becoming more accessible to patients.', 'The aim of the study was to compare the access of patients with rare diseases (RDs) to biotechnological drugs in several Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). We focused on the legislative pricing and reimbursement requirements, availability of biotechnological orphan medicinal products (BOMPs) for RDs, and reimbursement expenditures.  A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among experts from 10 CEECs: Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, and Macedonia. The legal requirements for reimbursement and pricing of BOMPs were collected. All BOMPs and medicines without prior orphan designations were extracted from the European list of orphan medicinal products, 2017. The reimbursement status of these medicinal products in 2017 in the public coverage of the included CEECs as well as the share of their costs in relation to the total public pharmaceutical spending for the period from 2014 to 2016 were defined.  Our survey revealed that some differences in the legal requirements for pricing and reimbursement of BOMPs amongst the countries included in the study. All European Union countries have developed and implemented pharmacoeconomic guidelines with or without some specific reimbursement requirements for orphan medicinal products. Cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, Markov models, meta-analysis, and discount levels of costs and results were required only in Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary. The number of reimbursed BOMPs and biotechnological medicinal products for RDs without prior orphan designation was the highest in Hungary (17 and 40, respectively). Patient-based reimbursement schemes were available only in Hungary for 11 out of 17 BOMPs. Poland and Greece have the highest pharmaceutical expenditure of reimbursed BOMPs with are similar to 214 million and 180 million EUR, respectively in the observed period from 2014 to 2016. High proportion of the pharmaceutical expenditure on the reimbursed biotechnological medicinal products for RDs for the observed period 2014-2016 is presented in Bulgaria and Slovakia.  The non-European Union CEECs face a significant delay in the legal implementation of pharmacoeconomic guideline for assessment of BOMPs. The access to BOMPs is similar among the observed CEECs and the countries with the best access are Hungary and Greece. The influence of BOMP expenditures on the budget in the individual countries is significant.']"

Findings in patients with diabetes were similar to those in patients without diabetes. The frequency of adverse events related to volume depletion, renal dysfunction, and hypoglycemia did not differ between treatment groups.

Whether SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in patients with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction remains less certain. We randomly assigned 6263 patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40% to receive dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) or matching placebo, in addition to usual therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (which was defined as either an unplanned hospitalization for heart failure or an urgent visit for heart failure) or cardiovascular death, as assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Over a median of 2.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 512 of 3131 patients (16.4%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 610 of 3132 patients (19.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.92; P < 0.001).

Total events and symptom burden were lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. were similar among patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% or more and those with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%, and results were similar in prespecified subgroups, including patients with or without diabetes. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

To fill this gap, we apply the Andersen's Behavioural Model, a commonly used framework, to determine the factors that impact the utilization of health care services in our country. Data are collected in an online survey conducted in Bulgaria in 2023 among consumers. The standardized questionnaire includes questions on the utilization of health care services used by the respondent during the preceding 12 months. We apply binary logistic regressions to analyze predictors of visits to general practitioners and medical specialists, as well as hospitalizations. The results of the regression analysis show that the factors of self-reported health status and the presence of a chronic disease influence the utilization of health care services except for general practitioner visits. Greater trust in general practitioners and hospitals is associated with an increased probability of undergoing examinations and hospitalizations. Predisposing and enabling characteristics appear as significant determinants of health care utilization. The study confirms the relevance of the Behavioural Model for the use of health care services in the Bulgarian context. Further research on health outcomes and their impact on utilization can help determine the most efficient level and appropriateness of the use of health care services."", ""The training of nurses is a key issue on which the provision of access to and quality of medical care depends. The shortage of nurses and the unfavorable ratio between nurses and doctors create problems in the proper organiza-tion of the provision of medical care.

A lower level of satisfaction of the students with the equipment and facili-ties where they do their pre-graduation traineeship is usu-ally associated with a lack of sufficient personal protec-tive equipment and other consumables in the healthcare establishments.  Probably due to difficulties in perform-ing nursing tasks in a real-life environment ensuing from organizational problems connected with the provision of consumables and materials, risks of accidents, the existing outdated facilities are the main reasons for the lower levels of satisfaction of students with the facilities during their pre-graduation traineeship."", 'Specialists working in health care are the main ssets which each EU member state has.

Considering that anti-C3 autoantibodies play a significant role in LN pathophysiology, we explored them as disease activity biomarkers and compared them to the ones against the homologous protein, C4.  We investigated the presence of anti-C3 and anti-C4 IgG autoantibodies in a LN cohort (N = 85 patients) and monitored their changes over time. We correlated autoantibody presence with clinical parameters. We conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (N = 295 samples, 8 years follow-up) to explore associations between autoantibodies and disease progression. Antigen-specific anti-C3 or anti-C4 IgG were purified from plasma by affinity chromatography and their reactivity was tested for crossreactivity against purified C3 or C4 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The reactivity against C3 was independent of C4. Our study revealed distinct roles for anti-C3 and anti-C4 in LN. Anti-C3 IgG exhibited stronger clinical correlations than anti-C4, showing associations with hypocomplementemia, anti-dsDNA, class IV LN, and active disease according to British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) renal score. In a longitudinal analysis, anti-C3 positivity at initial sampling predicted present and future disease exacerbation alone and even better when combined with anti-dsDNA, as indicated by a transition to BILAG category A.  Our research provides insights into anti-C3/C3b and anti-C4 autoantibodies in LN, revealing that they are often not cross-reactive. Anti-C3 utility as disease activity biomarkers is underscored by its stronger clinical associations and predictive value for future flares. Combining anti-C3 and anti-dsDNA outperforms the 2 factors alone, suggesting that the incorporation of anti-C3/C3b quantification into routine clinical practice could improve LN management. 2024 International Society of Nephrology.

We have hypothesized that it should be possible to suppress selectively the activity of these B cells in lupus mice by administering to them an artificial molecule that cross-links their surface immunoglobulins with the inhibitory Fc gamma IIb surface receptors. A hybrid molecule was constructed by coupling the DNA-mimicking DWEYSVWLSN peptide to a monoclonal anti-mouse Fc gamma RIIb antibody. This chimeric antibody was added to cultured spleen cells from sick MRL/1pr mice, immunized with diphtheria toxoid, resulting in reduction of the numbers of anti-DNA but not of anti-diphtheria IgG antibody-producing cells. Intravenous infusions with the DNA-peptide antibody chimera to 7-wk-old animals prevented the appearance of IgG anti-DNA antibodies and of albuminuria in the next 2 months. The administration of the DNA-peptide chimeric antibody to 18 wk-old mice with full-blown disease resulted in the maintenance of a flat level of IgG anti-DNA antibodies and in delay of the aggravation of the lupus glomerulonephritis. The use of chimeric antibodies targeting inhibitory B lymphocyte receptors represents a novel approach for the selective suppression of autoreactive disease-associated B cells in autoimmune diseases.', 'Lupus nephritis (LN) is a complication of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Because the complement system plays a critical role in orchestrating inflammatory and immune responses as well as in the clearance of immune complexes, autoreactivity to complement components may have considerable pathological consequences. Autoantibodies against the central complement component C3 have been reported in systemic lupus erythematosus, but their molecular mechanism and functional relevance are not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the functional properties of the anti-C3 autoantibodies. Anti-C3 autoantibodies were measured in plasma of 39 LN patients, and identification of their epitopes on the C3 molecule was performed. By using surface plasmon resonance, we analyzed the influence of patient-derived IgG antibodies on the interaction of C3b with Factor B, Factor H, and complement receptor 1. The capacity of these antibodies to dysregulate the C3 convertase on the surface of endothelial cell was measured by flow cytometry. Here we report that the frequency of anti-C3 autoantibodies in LNis similar to 30%. They inhibited interactions of the negative complement regulators Factor H and complement receptor 1 with C3b. An enhanced C3 deposition was also observed on human endothelial cells in the presence of C3 autoantibodies. In addition, anti-C3 autoantibody levels correlated with disease activity. In conclusion, the anti-C3 autoantibodies in LN may contribute to the autoimmune pathology by their capacity to overactivate the complement system.']"

Their molecular basis is poorly understood due to the extensive genetic and clinical heterogeneity, posing considerable challenges for patients, physicians, and researchers. We report on the genetic findings from a systematic study of a large collection of 174 independent ARCMT families. Initial sequencing of the three most common ARCMT genes (ganglioside-induced differentiation protein 1-GDAP1, SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats-containing protein 2-SH3TC2, histidine-triad nucleotide binding protein 1-HINT1) identified pathogenic mutations in 41 patients. Subsequently, 87 selected nuclear families underwent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and homozygosity mapping, followed by targeted screening of known ARCMT genes. This strategy provided molecular diagnosis to 22 % of the families. Altogether, our unbiased genetic approach identified pathogenic mutations in ten ARCMT genes in a total of 41.3 % patients. Apart from a newly described founder mutation in GDAP1, the majority of variants constitute private molecular defects. Since the gene testing was independent of the clinical phenotype of the patients, we identified mutations in patients with unusual or additional clinical features, extending the phenotypic spectrum of the SH3TC2 gene. Our study provides an overview of the ARCMT genetic landscape and proposes guidelines for tackling the genetic heterogeneity of this group of hereditary neuropathies.', ""Spinal muscular atrophy is a disorder of lower motor neurons, most commonly caused by recessive mutations in SMN1 on chromosome 5q. Cases without SMN1 mutations are subclassified according to phenotype. Spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity-predominant, is characterized by lower limb muscle weakness and wasting, associated with reduced numbers of lumbar motor neurons and is caused by mutations in DYNC1H1, which encodes a microtubule motor protein in the dynein-dynactin complex and one of its cargo adaptors, BICD2. We have now identified 32 patients with BICD2 mutations from nine different families, providing detailed insights into the clinical phenotype and natural history of BICD2 disease. BICD2 spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity predominant most commonly presents with delayed motor milestones and ankle contractures. Additional features at presentation include arthrogryposis and congenital dislocation of the hips. In all affected individuals, weakness and wasting is lower-limb predominant, and typically involves both proximal and distal muscle groups. There is no evidence of sensory nerve involvement. Upper motor neuron signs are a prominent feature in a subset of individuals, including one family with exclusively adult-onset upper motor neuron features, consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia. In all cohort members, lower motor neuron features were static or only slowly progressive, and the majority remained ambulant throughout life. Muscle MRI in six individuals showed a common pattern of muscle involvement with fat deposition in most thigh muscles, but sparing of the adductors and semitendinosus. Muscle pathology findings were highly variable and included pseudomyopathic features, neuropathic features, and minimal change. The six causative mutations, including one not previously reported, result in amino acid changes within all three coiled-coil domains of the BICD2 protein, and include a possible 'hot spot' mutation, p.Ser107Leu present in four families. We used the recently solved crystal structure of a highly conserved region of the Drosophila orthologue of BICD2 to further-explore how the p. Glu774Gly substitution inhibits the binding of BICD2 to Rab6. Overall, the features of BICD2 spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity predominant are consistent with a pathological process that preferentially affects lumbar lower motor neurons, with or without additional upper motor neuron involvement. Defining the phenotypic features in this, the largest BICD2 disease cohort reported to date, will facilitate focused genetic testing and filtering of next generation sequencing-derived variants in cases with similar features."", 'and Inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) are a group of genetic disorders of the peripheral nervous system in which neuropathy is the only or the most predominant clinical feature. The most common type of IPN is Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Autosomal recessive CMT (ARCMT) is generally more severe than dominant CMT and its genetic basis is poorly understood due to high clinical and genetic diversity. Here, we report clinical and genetic findings from 56 consanguineous Turkish families initially diagnosed with CMT disease. We initially screened the GDAP1 gene in our cohort as it is the most commonly mutated ARCMT gene. Next, whole-exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping based on whole-exome sequencing (HOMWES) analysis was performed. To understand the molecular impact of candidate causative genes, functional analyses were performed in patient primary fibroblasts. Biallelic recurrent mutations in the GDAP1 gene have been identified in 6 patients. Whole-exome sequencing and HOMWES analysis revealed 16 recurrent and 13 novel disease-causing alleles in known IPN-related genes and 2 novel candidate genes: 1 for a CMT-like disease and 1 for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy. We have achieved a potential genetic diagnosis rate of 62.5% (35/56 families) in our cohort. Considering only the variants that meet the American College for Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, the definitive diagnosis rate was 55.35% (31/56 families). Discussion This study paints a genetic landscape of the Turkish ARCMT population and reports additional candidate genes that might help enlighten the mechanism of pathogenesis of the disease.']"

The antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates was investigated. Snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of Bulgaria. One hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of LAB, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. Representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. The snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by Enterococcus (17 isolates), Lactococcus (12 isolates), Leuconostoc (7 isolates), Lactobacillus (18 isolates) and Weissella (1 isolate). The species affiliation of Lactococcus lactis (12), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and Lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. The Lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence analysis of 16S rDNA as Lactobacillus brevis (12), L. plantarum (2), Lactobacillus graminis (1) and Lactobacillus curvatus (3). The species L. brevis, L. graminis and L. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas L. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. Antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of L. mesentereoides P4/8 against Propionibacterium acnes.

Eight of the strains from yoghurt were phenotypically similar to Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Other seven isolates from cheese and yoghurt were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, according to classical tests and API LAB profiles. Their species affiliation was confirmed by species-specific and multiplex PCR. The molecular-based methods allowed reclassifying two cheese isolates determined as L. paracasei. L. plantarum was the predominant species in cheese samples and referred as member of non-starter lactic acid bacteria. Two of the new isolated L. plantarum strains showed anti-E. coli activity.', 'Today people focus on healthy lifestyle. It is well known that probiotics have a number of beneficial health effects in humans. They play an important role in protecting the host against harmful microorganisms, reduce metabolic disorders and support immune functions. In the present study, we investigated 26 probiotic products: 16 commercially available ones and 10 from a local manufacturer. None of the commercial products contained all labelled LAB and some of them contained unacceptable microorganisms. Of 890 isolated strains only 420 met the criteria for LAB. Ninety-seven strains were investigated by phenotypic and genotypic methods. 16S-23S rDNA amplification was performed for all putative LAB isolates. Fifty-seven rod-shaped bacteria referred to genus Lactobacillus and 16 coccus bacteria, to genus Weissela. Two-step multiplex PCR identified the rod-shaped strains to belong to four species: Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (three strains), Lactobacillus acidophilus (four strains), Lactobacillus casei (three strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (two strains), Lactobacillus reuteri (four strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (one strain). The transit tolerance of the isolated bacteria to in vitro simulated gastric juice (pH 2) was examined. Only four strains survived after 90 min of incubation. The antimicrobial activity of the native supernatants of the isolates was tested and 10 of them showed slight activity against three pathogenic bacteria. Our results demonstrated that only freshly produced products possessed the expected number of viable cells. The data revealed that one of the most common problems is the lower concentration of viable cells, misidentification and the presence of undesired microflora.']"

Filipov's novel method for biplane double-supported screw fixation (BDSF), using three cannulated screws, has demonstrated excellent clinical results since 2007. Its two calcar-buttressed screws are oriented in different coronal inclinations with steeper angles to the diaphyseal axis and intended to provide constant fixation strength under different loading situations. The aim of this study was to biomechanically evaluate BDSF fixation strength and compare it with the conventional fixation (CFIX) using three parallel cannulated screws.  Eight fresh-frozen and six embalmed human femoral pairs with simulated AO/OTA31-B2.2 fracture were fixed applying either CFIX or BDSF. Quasistatic tests were performed in anteroposterior (AP) bending, followed by axial quasistatic, cyclic and destructive quasistatic tests run in 10 degrees flexion with 7 degrees or 16 degrees varus specimen inclination.  Initial axial stiffness was significantly higher for BDSF in comparison with CFIX at 7 degrees inclination (p = 0.02) and not significantly different between BDSF and CFIX at 16 degrees inclination. Compared with the intact state, it decreased significantly at 7 degrees inclination only for CFIX (p = 0.01), but not for BDSF. Interfragmentary displacement during cyclic testing was significantly smaller for BDSF than CFIX at 7 degrees inclination (p <= 0.04) and not significantly different between BDSF and CFIX at 16 degrees inclination. Failure load did not differ significantly between BDSF and CFIX at both inclinations.  Femoral neck fracture stability can be substantially increased applying BDSF due to better cortical screw support and screw orientation. Having two calcar-buttressed screws oriented in different inclinations, BDSF can enhance constant stability during various patient activities. The more unstable the situation, the better BDSF stability is in comparison to CFIX."", ""Osteosynthesis of femoral neck fractures is related up to 46% rate of complications. The novel method of biplane double-supported screw fixation (BDSF; Filipov's method) offers better stability using three medially diverging cannulated screws with two of them buttressed on the calcar. Biomechanically, the most effective component is the distal screw placed at steeper angle and supported on a large area along the distal and posterior cortex of the femoral neck following its spiral anterior curve. Thereby, BDSF achieves the strongest possible distal-posterior cortical support for the fixation construct, which allows for immediate full weight-bearing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes from the first 5-year period of BDSF clinical application. Subject of this retrospective study were 207 patients with displaced Garden III-IV femoral neck fractures treated with BDSF. Three 7.3-mm cannulated screws were laid in two medially diverging oblique planes. The distal and the middle screws were supported on the calcar. The distal screw had additional support on the posterior neck cortex. The outcomes in 207 patients were analysed in 29.6 +/- 16.8 months follow-up. Bone union occurred in 96.6% of the cases (males 97.6%, females 96.4%, P = 0.99). Rate of nonunion was 3.4%, including fixation failure (2.4%), pseudoarthrosis (0.5%) and nonunion with AVN (0.5%). Rate of AVN was 12.1% (males 4.8%, females 13.9%, P = 0.12). Modified Harris hip score was 86.2 +/- 18.9 (range 10-100), with no significant difference between genders, P = 0.07. Older patients were admitted with significantly more comorbidities (P = 0.001), and on follow-up they were significantly less mobile (P = 0.005) and had significantly more difficulties to put socks and shoes on (P < 0.001).

The most critical factor with potential high risk level for formation of water quality in this river sector is the discharge of ineffectively treated wastewaters from Samokov WWTP and untreated sewages from the small villages. The adequate ecosystem response to this organic pollution is based on the self-purification capacity of the river and the advisable functional structure, activity and metabolism of the microbial communities. During the study period one significant deterioration in water quality has been registered in February 2004. The analyses of hydrochemical parameters showed an organic pollution in river waters below the WWTP influx. This impact activated the self-purification capacity of river ecosystem and the key microbial communities responded with changes on structural and functional levels. The six-fold increase in the number of heterotrophic and coliform bacteria was observed in river channel but at some distance downstream. In the discharge point, the first reaction of the biocenoses was presented on enzymatic level by the significant enhancement in the values of total dehydrogenase activity and the phosphatase activity index. The obtained results for functional microbial response to accidental organic pollution are a good base to formulate bioalgorithms for control and management of water quality and self-purification capacity of Iskar River ecosystem in similar risk situations.', 'The introduction of an integration approach for management of the water basins, including assessment and control of stream water quality and sediment qualify, as well as regulation of the pollutant influx in the water receiver, is necessary. The changes in the microbial communities, as a response to the chronic discharge of untreated dairy wastewater: were followed in river and in depth, in three river components stream water - sediment water - sediments. The water quality of Leva River decreased after diary wastewater discharge as the microbial communities reacted with structural and functional changes, related with of aerobic heterotrophs and the values of total dehydrogenase activity and phosphatase activity index. The result was a decrease of organic matter and nutrients in the stream water in Station 4. However, an improvement Of river water quality was not ascertained according to the Bulgarian State Standard. The applied ecological theory for r/K- strategists showed that in the stream water the microbial community is presented with fast growing populations, while in the sediment water and sediments prevailed slow growing bacteria. In the sediments aerobic heterotrophs were with higher density and showed higher activities of total de-hydrogenase, phosphatase and protease. The obtained results confirmed that microbial community in the sediment zone is an important factor for the regulation of the transformation processes of organic matter and nutrients in water and sediments, as well as for the formation of river water quality in water receiver.']"

The strongest mediation effect of parental diet quality was found on the association between the frequency of family breakfast and the consumption of salty snacks and milk and milk products (62.5% and 37.5%, respectively) among girls.  The frequency of family meals is positively associated with improved food consumption patterns (i.e., higher intake of fruits and vegetables and reduced consumption of sweets) in both parents and children.

Cervical smears of 421 Bulgarian women attending routine gynaecological examinations during the three-year study period were stained by the Pap technique and classified by the Bethesda system. GenoFlow HPV Array Test Kit was used to analyse the HPV status in the collected cervical samples. The results showed that, of the 421 women, 177 (42%) were HPV(+) and 244 (58%) were HPV(-); 334 (79.3%) Pap smears were with normal morphology and 87 (20.7%) had high/low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL/HSIL) changes. Of the 87 women with LSIL/HSIL changes, 54% (47/87) were HPV(-) and 46% (40/87) were HPV(+). There was no statistically significant correlation between the HPV(+) status and the cytological LSIL/HSIL findings (P > 0.05). Koilocytes were found in 30.4% (128/421) of the samples. Of the 128 women with koilocytosis, 59.4% (76/128) were HPV(-) and 40.6% (52/128) were HPV(+). There was no significant correlation (P > 0.05) between the presence of koilocytes in cervical smears and HPV infection. Our results suggest that HPV infection is frequent even in women with negative Pap-smear results, and polymerase chain reaction seems to be the only reliable test to diagnose this infection. However, the results from this study cannot be considered to fully support the replacement of cytology and colposcopy examination in cervical cancer screening with HPV genotyping tests only.', ""and objectives: Adenosquamous cancer of the uterine cervix is a rare type of cervical cancer with both malignant squamous and glandular components. A very rare subtype is mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), which was first described as a salivary gland tumor. It has been described as having the appearance of a squamous cell carcinoma without glandular formation and contains intracellular mucin. The postoperative evolution of this tumor and the potentially poorer prognosis may indicate an intensification of the follow-up. The objective of our study was to analyze the frequency of mucoepidermoid carcinoma in hospitalized women with cervical cancer, clinical characteristics and prognosis. Material and  A retrospective study of all cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the cervix at Department of Gynecologic Oncology, University Hospital-Pleven, Pleven Bulgaria between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2016 was performed. All patients were followed-up till December 2019. We analyzed certain clinical characteristics of the patients; calculated the frequency of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the cervix from all patients with stage I cervical cancer; and looked at the overall survival rate, correlation between overall survival, lymph node status and the size of the tumor.  The frequency of MEC was 1.12% of all patients with stage I cervical cancer in this study. The median age of the patients with MEC was 46.7 years (range 38-62). Four patients (57.1%) were staged as FIGO IB1, and three patients (42.8%) were FIGO IB2. The size of the primary tumor was <2 cm in 2 patients (28.57%), 2-4 cm in 2 patients (28.57%) and >4 cm in 3 patients (42.8%). Metastatic lymph nodes were found in two patients (28.57%), and nonmetastatic lymph nodes were found in five patients (71.43%). There were two (28.57%) disease-related deaths during the study period. The five-year observed survival in the MEC group was 85.7% and in the other subtypes of adenosquamous cancer group was 78.3%.  MEC of the uterine cervix is a rare entity diagnosis. As a mucin-producing tumor, it is frequently regarded as a subtype with worse clinical behavior and patients' outcomes. Nevertheless, our data did not confirm this prognosis. New molecular markers and better stratification are needed for better selection of patients with CC, which may benefit more from additional treatment and new target therapies."", 'Cervical carcinoma is a leading cause of mortality from cancer among women worldwide. Oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are recognised as causative agents of cervical cancer and its precursor, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It was shown that successful treatment of CIN results in clearance of HPV infection and treatment failure is accompanied by the detection of viral persistence. Therefore, follow-up testing for HPV of CIN treated patients is now accepted as an option for monitoring for recurrent disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of high risk HPV after treatment of Bulgarian women for high-grade CIN. Cervical specimens were obtained from 59 women treated for CIN by conization. They were subjected to Pap smear test and HPV DNA testing by PCR. Cytological abnormalities were found in 18.6% of all women. HPV DNA was detected in 91% of women with abnormal cytology. Only 8.3% of women with normal cytology were HPV positive. HPV genotyping showed that the most prevalent HPV type was HPV16 accounting for 80% of HPV positive samples with abnormal cytology and for 25% of HPV positive samples with normal cytology. HPV18 was detected only in one specimen with abnormal cytology. HPV31 was found in 50% of all HPV positive materials. We were not able to detect HPV33. Our study indicates that the posttreatment high risk HPV infection detected in Bulgarian women is a risk factor for subsequent cervical dysplasia and that the high risk HPV testing after conization is important for predicting the risk of disease recurrence.']"

Drought triggers diverse cellular processes including the inhibition of photosynthesis, the accumulation of cell-damaging reactive oxygen species and gene expression reprogramming, besides others. Transcription factors (TF) are central regulators of transcriptional reprogramming and expression of many TF genes is affected by drought, including members of the NAC family. Here, we identify the NAC factor JUNGBRUNNEN1 (JUB1) as a regulator of drought tolerance in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Expression of tomato JUB1 (SlJUB1) is enhanced by various abiotic stresses, including drought. Inhibiting SlJUB1 by virus-induced gene silencing drastically lowers drought tolerance concomitant with an increase in ion leakage, an elevation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and a decrease in the expression of various drought-responsive genes. In contrast, overexpression of AtJUB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana increases drought tolerance in tomato, alongside with a higher relative leaf water content during drought and reduced H2O2 levels. AtJUB1 was previously shown to stimulate expression of DREB2A, a TF involved in drought responses, and of the DELLA genes GAI and RGL1. We show here that SlJUB1 similarly controls the expression of the tomato orthologs SlDREB1, SlDREB2 and SlDELLA. Furthermore, AtJUB1 directly binds to the promoters of SlDREB1, SlDREB2 and SlDELLA in tomato. Our study highlights JUB1 as a transcriptional regulator of drought tolerance and suggests considerable conservation of the abiotic stress-related gene regulatory networks controlled by this NAC factor between Arabidopsis and tomato.', 'Haberlea rhodopensis is a resurrection plant with remarkable tolerance to desiccation. Haberlea exposed to drought stress, desiccation, and subsequent rehydration showed no signs of damage or severe oxidative stress compared to untreated control plants. Transcriptome analysis by next-generation sequencing revealed a drought-induced reprogramming, which redirected resources from growth towards cell protection. Repression of photosynthetic and growth-related genes during water deficiency was concomitant with induction of transcription factors (members of the NAC, NF-YA, MADS box, HSF, GRAS, and WRKY families) presumably acting as master switches of the genetic reprogramming, as well as with an upregulation of genes related to sugar metabolism, signaling, and genes encoding early light-inducible (ELIP), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA), and heat shock (HSP) proteins. At the same time, genes encoding other LEA, HSP, and stress protective proteins were constitutively expressed at high levels even in unstressed controls. Genes normally involved in tolerance to salinity, chilling, and pathogens were also highly induced, suggesting a possible cross-tolerance against a number of abiotic and biotic stress factors. A notable percentage of the genes highly regulated in dehydration and subsequent rehydration were novel, with no sequence homology to genes from other plant genomes. Additionally, an extensive antioxidant gene network was identified with several gene families possessing a greater number of antioxidant genes than most other species with sequenced genomes. Two of the transcripts most abundant during all conditions encoded catalases and five more catalases were induced in water-deficient samples. Using the pharmacological inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (AT) to compromise catalase activity resulted in increased sensitivity to desiccation. Metabolome analysis by GC or LC-MS revealed accumulation of sucrose, verbascose, spermidine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid during drought, as well as particular secondary metabolites accumulating during rehydration. This observation, together with the complex antioxidant system and the constitutive expression of stress protective genes suggests that both constitutive and inducible mechanisms contribute to the extreme desiccation tolerance of H. rhodopensis.', 'Resurrection plants are a small but diverse group of land plants characterized by their tolerance to extreme drought or desiccation. They have the unique ability to survive months to years without water, lose most of the free water in their vegetative tissues, fall into anabiosis, and, upon rewatering, quickly regain normal activity. Thus, they are fundamentally different from other drought-surviving plants such as succulents or ephemerals, which cope with drought by maintaining higher steady state water potential or via a short life cycle, respectively. This review describes the unique physiological and molecular adaptations of resurrection plants enabling them to withstand long periods of desiccation. The recent transcriptome analysis of Craterostigma plantagineum and Haberlea rhodopensis under drought, desiccation, and subsequent rehydration revealed common genetic pathways with other desiccation-tolerant species as well as unique genes that might contribute to the outstanding desiccation tolerance of the two resurrection species. While some of the molecular responses appear to be common for both drought stress and desiccation, resurrection plants also possess genes that are highly induced or repressed during desiccation with no apparent sequence homologies to genes of other species. Thus, resurrection plants are potential sources for gene discovery. Further proteome and metabolome analyses of the resurrection plants contributed to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that are involved in surviving severe water loss. Understanding the cellular mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in this unique group of plants may enable future molecular improvement of drought tolerance in crop plants.']"

CML is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell disease common to myelo- and lymphopoiesis, characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of granulopoiesis (Shuvaev et al. 2015; Yordanov and Varbanova 2019). Relevance and goals: Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib) have an advantage over imatinib (first-generation) in the frequency and speed of achieving cytogenetic and molecular responses in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but they cause severe adverse effects and are much more expensive than imatinib, especially if we compare them to the prices of the registered generic products of Imatinib and Dasatinib. Novartis Tasigna (R) trial shows superior results to Glivec (R) in patients with early-stage chronic myeloid leukemia, reported on 10/20/2021 by Pierre Perrin-Montlouis. In the first direct comparison of these two oral therapies back in 2009 (& Tcy;asigna (nilotinib) 2009), as first-line treatment for CML, the results of Tasigna showed statistically significant improvement over Glivec in every measure of efficacy, including major molecular response (MMR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and prevention of progression to accelerated or blast phase, with responses achieved faster in the Tasigna group than in the Glivec group. Furthermore, in the last ten years, CML patients who have achieved a stable deep molecular response for at least 2 years have been included in clinical trials for the management of treatment-free remission (TFR) (Kim et al. 2013; Sau ss ele et al. 2016). On the other hand, the ever-increasing costs of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of the response of CML to the various therapeutic strategies require conducting pharmacoeconomic analyses of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility types in order to evaluate which are the cost-effective strategies with a view to introducing them into therapeutic practice. The present study aims to analyze the pharmacoeconomic efficiency of the TKI inhibitors used by the patients with CML-CP in the first and second lines, treated in the hematology clinic at UMHAT St. George, MU- Plovdiv during the period 2018-2022.  An economic analysis of the medicinal use of TKIs for a 5-year period (2018-2022) was performed at the national level according to data from the National Health Insurance Fund and the availability, accessibility, and usability of original and generic TKIs in Bulgaria were evaluated. The direct medical costs for the therapy of all patients were calculated, including the costs of the TKI therapy, laboratory tests, and monitoring of the molecular response for the entire treatment period from the appointment of the TKI therapy until the end of 2022. A comparative analysis was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of the different therapeutic strategies with TKIs on the first and second lines of treatment of patients with CML-CP in the hematology clinic at UMHAT St. George Medical University, Plovdiv, using the decision analysis method and conducting one-way and probalistic sensitivity analyses.  The sensitivity analyzes of all pharmacoeconomic models showed the robustness and reliability of the obtained results. The threshold limits of medical costs and the frequency of achieving a deep molecular response determining the choice of first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors as first- and second-line therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase have been determined. Prescribing doctors prefer the original MPs to generic analogues, which is also assumed by the current regulations, according to which even for expensive MPs dispensing by protocols, the prescription is by trade and not by international non-proprietary names (INN), which is why the use of the much cheaper generic MPs is negligibly low compared to original MPs. A personalized approach to the patient's therapy and monitoring the patient's molecular response to it, as well as stopping therapy in 25-30% of patients suitable to stop it safely when in TFR phase with a probability of more than 50% of not having a relapse will save additional costs that, by improving the cost-effectiveness of therapy for patients with CML, will be directed towards the treatment of new patients with this or other diseases.  These pharmacoeconomic models can be applied to improve diagnostic and therapeutic standards in clinical practice and for the efficient use of the very limited resources for health care in countries like Bulgaria. The conducted cost-effectiveness analyses confirmed that the hematologists at the University Center in Plovdiv adhere to the recommendations of Leukemia Net and the Bulgarian Medical Society of Hematology and achieve not only good therapeutic but also pharmacoeconomic efficiency in the treatment of CML-& Scy;& Rcy; patients in first- and second- line therapy."", 'Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is a reference treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma.

Serious adverse events were reported in 224 (48%) of 463 patients in the carfilzomib group and in 162 (36%) of 456 patients in the bortezomib group. The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were anaemia (67 [14%] of 463 patients in the carfilzomib group vs 45 [10%] of 456 patients in the bortezomib group), hypertension (41 [9%] vs 12 [3%]), thrombocytopenia (39 [8%] vs 43 [9%]), and pneumonia (32 [7%] vs 36 [8%]).

However, data on how CAM contacts vary across countries, mental disorders and their severity, and health care settings is largely lacking. The aim was therefore to investigate the prevalence of contacts with CAM providers in a large cross-national sample of persons with 12-month mental disorders. In the World Mental Health Surveys, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was administered to determine the presence of past 12 month mental disorders in 138 801 participants aged 18-100 derived from representative general population samples. Participants were recruited between 2001 and 2012. Rates of self-reported CAM contacts for each of the 28 surveys across 25 countries and 12 mental disorder groups were calculated for all persons with past 12-month mental disorders. Mental disorders were grouped into mood disorders, anxiety disorders or behavioural disorders, and further divided by severity levels. Satisfaction with conventional care was also compared with CAM contact satisfaction.  An estimated 3.6% (standard error 0.2%) of persons with a past 12-month mental disorder reported a CAM contact, which was two times higher in high-income countries (4.6%; standard error 0.3%) than in low- and middle-income countries (2.3%; standard error 0.2%). CAM contacts were largely comparable for different disorder types, but particularly high in persons receiving conventional care (8.6-17.8%). CAM contacts increased with increasing mental disorder severity. Among persons receiving specialist mental health care, CAM contacts were reported by 14.0% for severe mood disorders, 16.2% for severe anxiety disorders and 22.5% for severe behavioural disorders. Satisfaction with care was comparable with respect to CAM contacts (78.3%) and conventional care (75.6%) in persons that received both. CAM contacts are common in persons with severe mental disorders, in high-income countries, and in persons receiving conventional care. Our findings support the notion of CAM as largely complementary but are in contrast to suggestions that this concerns person with only mild, transient complaints. There was no indication that persons were less satisfied by CAM visits than by receiving conventional care. We encourage health care professionals in conventional settings to openly discuss the care patients are receiving, whether conventional or not, and their reasons for doing so.', 'Anxiety disorders are a major cause of burden of disease. Treatment gaps have been described, but a worldwide evaluation is lacking. We estimated, among individuals with a 12-month DSM-IV (where DSM is Diagnostic Statistical Manual) anxiety disorder in 21 countries, the proportion who (i) perceived a need for treatment; (ii) received any treatment; and (iii) received possibly adequate treatment.  Data from 23 community surveys in 21 countries of the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed (WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview, CIDI 3.0). DSM-IV included posttraumatic stress disorder among anxiety disorders, while it is not considered so in the DSM-5. We asked if, in the previous 12 months, respondents felt they needed professional treatment and if they obtained professional treatment (specialized/general medical, complementary alternative medical, or nonmedical professional) for problems with emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs. Possibly adequate treatment was defined as receiving pharmacotherapy (1+ months of medication and 4+ visits to a medical doctor) or psychotherapy, complementary alternative medicine or nonmedical care (8+ visits).  Of 51,547 respondents (response = 71.3%), 9.8% had a 12-month DSM-IV anxiety disorder, 27.6% of whom received any treatment, and only 9.8% received possibly adequate treatment. Of those with 12-month anxiety only 41.3% perceived a need for care. Lower treatment levels were found for lower income countries.  Low levels of service use and a high proportion of those receiving services not meeting adequacy standards for anxiety disorders exist worldwide. suggest the need for improving recognition of anxiety disorders and the quality of treatment.', 'The treatment gap between the number of people with mental disorders and the number treated represents a major public health challenge. We examine this gap by socio-economic status (SES; indicated by family income and respondent education) and service sector in a cross-national analysis of community epidemiological survey data.  Data come from 16 753 respondents with 12-month DSM-IV disorders from community surveys in 25 countries in the WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative. DSM-IV anxiety, mood, or substance disorders and treatment of these disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).  Only 13.7% of 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI cases in lower-middle-income countries, 22.0% in upper-middle-income countries, and 36.8% in high-income countries received treatment. Highest-SES respondents were somewhat more likely to receive treatment, but this was true mostly for specialty mental health treatment, where the association was positive with education (highest treatment among respondents with the highest education and a weak association of education with treatment among other respondents) but non-monotonic with income (somewhat lower treatment rates among middle-income respondents and equivalent among those with high and low incomes).  The modest, but nonetheless stronger, an association of education than income with treatment raises questions about a financial barriers interpretation of the inverse association of SES with treatment, although future within-country analyses that consider contextual factors might document other important specifications. While beyond the scope of this report, such an expanded analysis could have important implications for designing interventions aimed at increasing mental disorder treatment among socio-economically disadvantaged people.']"

In vivo, NO is released continuously. NO attenuates vessel constrictions and, therefore, exerts an anticontractile effect. It is unknown whether the anticontractile effect of continuously present NO is mediated by BK channels. and Results-This study tested the hypothesis that BK channels mediate the vasodilatory effect of continuously present NO. Experiments were performed on rat and mouse tail and rat saphenous arteries using isometric myography and FURA-2 fluorimetry. Continuously present NO donors, as well as endogenous NO, attenuated methoxamine-induced vasoconstrictions. This effect was augmented in the presence of the BK channel blocker iberiotoxin. Moreover, the contractile effect of iberiotoxin was reduced in the presence of NO donors. The effect of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was abolished by an NO scavenger and by a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. In addition, the effect of sodium nitroprusside was reduced considerably by a protein kinase G inhibitor, but was not altered by inhibition of H2S generation. Sodium nitroprusside attenuated the intracellular calcium concentration response to methoxamine. Furthermore, sodium nitroprusside strongly reduced methoxamine-induced calcium influx, which depends entirely on L-type calcium channels. It did not affect methoxamine-induced calcium release. Conclusions-In summary, this study demonstrates the following: (1) continuously present NO evokes a strong anticontractile effect on rat and mouse arteries; (2) the iberiotoxin-induced augmentation of the effect of NO is associated with an NO-induced reduction of the effect of iberiotoxin; and (3) NO evoked a reduction of calcium influx via L-type calcium channels.', 'Nitric oxide (NO) is a powerful vasodilator in different vascular beds and NO-donors are widely used in clinical practice. Early data suggested that NO and NO-donors activate vascular smooth muscle high-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels (BK channels). There exist two hypotheses explaining the effect of NO and NO-donors on BK channels-one stating that protein kinase G (PKG) mediates the effect of NO, and the other one stating that NO acts directly on the channel. Thus, the degree of contribution of PKG to the NO-induced activation of the BK channel is still not completely clear. This study tested the hypothesis that the sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced activation of vascular smooth muscle BK channels is fully mediated by PKG. This hypothesis was investigated using the patch-clamp technique and freshly isolated smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery. In whole-cell experiments, SNP considerably increased the outward current compared with the addition of the bath solution. SNP did not alter the current in the presence of iberiotoxin, the specific blocker of BK channels, during co-application with hydroxocobalamin, an NO-scavenger, and in the presence of Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS, the specific PKG-inhibitor. In inside-out patches, the activity of BK channels was increased by SNP, SNAP, and DEA-NO. However, these effects did not differ from the effect of the application of drug-free bath solution. Furthermore, a similar increase in single BK channel activity was induced by Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS together with SNP, hydroxocobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin together with SNP or DEA-NO. Finally, the activity of excised BK channels did not change in the absence of any application but was considerably increased by PKG compared with the addition of drug-free bath solution. These results suggest that NO released from NO-donors stimulates the BK current only through activation of PKG.', 'The aim of the present study was to characterize voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from rat tail main artery in the presence of 5 mmol L-1 external Ca2+. Calcium currents were identified on the basis of their voltage dependencies and sensitivity to nifedipine, Ni2+ and cinnarizine. In the majority of the cells studied, T- and L-type currents were observed, while the remaining cells showed predominantly L-type currents. In the latter group of cells, holding potential change from -50 to either -70 or -90 mV increased the corresponding inward current amplitude while its voltage activation threshold remained uncharged. The steady state inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels showed half-maximal inactivation at -38 mV. A Ca2+ dependent inactivation was also evident. Nifedipine (3 mu mol L-1) blocked L-type but not T-type Ca2+ currents. Ni2+ (50 mu mol L-1) as well as cinnarizine (1 mu mol L-1) suppressed the nifedipine-resistant, T-type component of the currents. At higher concentrations, both Ni2+ (0.3-1 mmol L-1) and cinnarizine (10 mu mol L-1) blocked the net inward current. Replacement of Ca2+ with 10 mmol L-1 Ba2+ significantly increased the amplitude of L-type Ca2+ currents. These results demonstrate that smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from rat tail main artery may be divided into two populations, one expressing both L- and T-type and the other only L-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, this report shows that in arterial smooth muscle cells cinnarizine potently inhibited T-type currents at low concentrations (1 mu mol L-1) but also blocked L-type Ca2+ currents at higher concentrations (10 mu mol L-1).']"

In this review, the individual contributions of factors (i-iv) to PLTF breakup patterns (BUP) and CLD are considered via the tear film-oriented diagnosis framework adopted by the Asia Dry Eye Society from a clinical and basic science perspective. It is shown that SCLRDE (due to aqueous deficiency, increased evaporation, or decreased wettability) and BUP of PLTF classify within the same types as the ones observed for the precorneal tear film. The analysis of PLTF dynamics reveals that the inclusion of SCL enhances the manifestation of BUP associated with (i) decreased thickness of PLTF aqueous layer and (ii) limited SCL wettability as shown by the rapid expansion of BUP area. PLTF thinness and instability result in increased blink-related friction and lid wiper epitheliopathy as major contributor to CLD.', ""Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a primary cause of dry eye syndrome, as the meibomian glands produce lipids that maintain tear film integrity and reduce its evaporation. Blockage of these glands can result in symptoms associated with dry eye disease. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy is a novel treatment option for dry eye syndrome caused by MGD.  The purpose of our study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of IPL for treating dry eye syndrome caused by MGD in various age groups, by analyzing the non-invasive tear breakup time (NITBUT) and Schirmer's test results both before and after two IPL treatments. Materials and methods: A total of 120 subjects, each with varying degrees of MGD, underwent IPL treatment in both eyes. Each patient received two procedures spaced two weeks apart. Tear breakup time (TBUT) and Schirmer's test were evaluated at baseline and two weeks following the final treatment.  The majority of tests demonstrated improvement in key clinical parameters, including tear breakup time, Schirmer's test, meibum quality, and the Standard Evaluation of Eye Dryness Questionnaire. IPL therapy shows therapeutic potential for treating MGD, enhancing tear film quality, and alleviating dry eye symptoms.  IPL presents a promising area for development, offering the potential for improved outcomes in patients with MGD, and is currently the focus of ongoing research."", 'The tear film at the ocular surface is covered by a thin layer of lipids. This oily phase stabilizes the film by decreasing its surface tension and improving its viscoelastic properties. Clinically, destabilization and rupture of the tear film are related to dry eye disease and are accompanied by changes in the quality and quantity of tear film lipids. In dry eye, eye drops containing oil-in-water emulsions are used for the supplementation of lipids and surface-active components to the tear film. We explore in detail the biophysical aspects of interactions of specific surface-active compounds, cetalkonium chloride and poloxamer 188, which are present in oil-in-water emulsions, with tear lipids. The aim is to better understand the macroscopically observed eye drops-tear film interactions by rationalizing them at the molecular level. To this end, we employ a multi-scale approach combining experiments on human meibomian lipid extracts, measurements using synthetic lipid films, and in silico molecular dynamics simulations. By combining these methods, we demonstrate that the studied compounds specifically interact with the tear lipid film enhancing its structure, surfactant properties, and elasticity. The observed effects are cooperative and can be further modulated by material packing at the tear-air interface.']"

Eukaryotic cells have evolved an impressive array of DNA repair mechanisms that are able to detect and repair these lesions, thus preventing genomic instability. The DNA repair process is subjected to precise spatiotemporal coordination, and repair proteins are recruited to lesions in an orderly fashion, depending on their function. Here, we present DNArepairK, a unique open-access database that contains the kinetics of recruitment and removal of 70 fluorescently tagged DNA repair proteins to complex DNA damage sites in living HeLa Kyoto cells. An interactive graphical representation of the data complemented with live cell imaging movies facilitates straightforward comparisons between the dynamics of proteins contributing to different DNA repair pathways. Notably, most of the proteins included in DNArepairK are represented by their kinetics in both nontreated and PARP1/2 inhibitor-treated (talazoparib) cells, thereby providing an unprecedented overview of the effects of anticancer drugs on the regular dynamics of the DNA damage response. We believe that the exclusive dataset available in DNArepairK will be of value to scientists exploring the DNA damage response but, also, to inform and guide the development and evaluation of novel DNA repair-targeting anticancer drugs.', 'Complex interactions among DNA and nuclear proteins maintain genome organization and stability. The nuclear proteins, particularly the histones, organize, compact, and preserve the stability of DNA, but also allow its dynamic reorganization whenever the nuclear processes require access to it. Five histone classes exist and they are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes. The linker histones are the fifth class and over time, their role in chromatin has been neglected. Linker histones interact with DNA and the other histones and thus sustain genome stability and nuclear organization. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a brilliant model for studying linker histones as the gene for it is a single-copy and is non-essential. We, therefore, created a linker histone-free yeast strain using a knockout of the relevant gene and traced the way cells age chronologically. Here we present our results demonstrating that the altered chromatin dynamics during the chronological lifespan of the yeast cells with a mutation in ARP4 (the actin-related protein 4) and without the gene HHO1 for the linker histone leads to strong alterations in the gene expression profiles of a subset of genes involved in DNA repair and autophagy. The obtained results further prove that the yeast mutants have reduced survival upon UVA/B irradiation possibly due to the accelerated decompaction of chromatin and impaired proliferation. Our hypothesis posits that the higher-order chromatin structure and the interactions among chromatin proteins are crucial for the maintenance of chromatin organization during chronological aging under optimal and UVA-B stress conditions.', 'Cellular DNA is constantly being damaged by numerous internal and external mutagenic factors. Probably the most severe type of insults DNA could suffer are the double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). They sever both DNA strands and compromise genomic stability, causing deleterious chromosomal aberrations that are implicated in numerous maladies, including cancer. Not surprisingly, cells have evolved several DSB repair pathways encompassing hundreds of different DNA repair proteins to cope with this challenge. In eukaryotic cells, DSB repair is fulfilled in the immensely complex environment of the chromatin. The chromatin is not just a passive background that accommodates the multitude of DNA repair proteins, but it is a highly dynamic and active participant in the repair process. Chromatin alterations, such as changing patterns of histone modifications shaped by numerous histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodeling, are pivotal for proficient DSB repair. Dynamic chromatin changes ensure accessibility to the damaged region, recruit DNA repair proteins, and regulate their association and activity, contributing to DSB repair pathway choice and coordination. Given the paramount importance of DSB repair in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, DSB repair has turned into an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer therapies, some of which have already entered the clinic.']"

In this study, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to characterize a population of 117 modern wheat varieties (Triticum aestivum L.) from Bulgaria and several Western, Central and Eastern European countries. The genetic diversity was higher in the Western and Central European varieties than in the Bulgarian and the remaining Eastern European ones. Model-based population structure analysis defined 2 sub-populations (K = 2) dividing the Central and Western European varieties from the Bulgarian ones. Subsequent genetic structure analysis at K = 3 revealed an additional separation of the Bulgarian varieties in two distinct sub-populations. The phenotypic diversity among the varieties was evaluated in the fields of Dobrudzha Agricultural Institute, G. Toshevo in North-Eastern Bulgaria for three consecutive years. The distribution of the varieties in the biplot analysis in terms of grain yield and its components revealed differences in their adaptation to the agro-climatic conditions of North Bulgaria according to their geographical origin. These results and the prevalence of specific SSR alleles in the sub-populations suggest distinct adaptive mechanisms to specific agro-ecological regions.

The genetic diversity in the modern durum wheat was 0.5612 with 6.88 alleles per locus. Model-based population STRUCTURE analysis identified two sub-populations (K = 2) separating the South Bulgarian varieties (SP1) from all others (SP2), including South-Western, Central-Eastern European and North Bulgarian ones. Subsequent genetic structure analysis at K = 4 revealed an additional division of each sub-population into two (SP1-2, SP1-4, SP2-1, SP2-3). DAPC analysis and UPGMA dendrogram based on SSR data were in excellent agreement with the Subpopulations defined by STRUCTURE analysis.

The phenotypic characterization during 3 consecutive years revealed significant differences among Bulgarian cultivars for the studied 13 phenotypic traits. The biplot analysis of quantitative traits showed that the most strongly correlating traits with the first axis (55.6% of variance) were fruit width, fruit weight and pericarp thickness (in the negative direction of the axis), and plant height (PH) (in the positive direction). The most discriminative traits, considering the second axis (22.6% of variance) were fruit length (FL) and to a lesser extent the stem height (StH). The correspondence analysis of the qualitative traits showed that the intensity of the colour of the fruit (before and at maturity), fruit colour before maturity and fruit shape in longitudinal section were the most discriminative characteristics for the first two dimensions. The agronomic traits data and 7 dinucleotide ISSR primers were used to estimate the pairwise genetic distances. Higher mean phenotypic distance (0.414) in comparison to the genotypic ones (0.214) among the cultivars was observed, indicating higher phenotypic diversity among them. A highly significant, positive correlation between the agronomic data and ISSR marker based matrices (r=0.41, p=0.001) was detected. This indicates that ISSR distance tended to reflect that of the agronomics ones. However, additional molecular studies and large collection of highly diverse genotypes are needed to reveal associations between the marker loci and specific QTLs. The research initiated is a base for more precise estimation of genetic distances between pepper genotypes from the available large collection of landraces, local and modern cultivars including large number of highly polymorphic markers.']"

FIPA can present with pituitary adenomas of any secretory/non-secretory type. Mutations in the gene for the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) have been identified in approximately 20% of FIPA families and are the most frequent cause (29%) of pituitary gigantism. Pituitary tumors in FIPA are larger, occur at a younger age and display more aggressive characteristics and evolution than sporadic adenomas. This aggressiveness is especially marked in FIPA kindreds with AIP mutations. Special attention should be paid to young patients with pituitary gigantism and/or macroadenomas, as AIP mutations are prevalent in these groups. Duplications on chromosome Xq26.3 involving the gene GPR101 lead to X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG), a syndrome of pituitary gigantism beginning in early childhood; three kindreds with X-LAG have presented in the setting of FIPA. Management of pituitary adenomas in the setting of FIPA, AIP mutations and GPR101 duplications is often more complex than in sporadic disease due to early onset disease, aggressive tumor growth and resistance to medical therapy.', 'AIP mutations (AIPmut) give rise to a pituitary adenoma predisposition that occurs in familial isolated pituitary adenomas and less often in sporadic cases.

Design: This study was an international, multicenter, retrospective case collection/database analysis. Setting: The study was conducted at 36 tertiary referral endocrine and clinical genetics departments. Patients: Patients included 96 patients with germline AIPmut and pituitary adenomas and 232 matched AIPmut-negative acromegaly controls.  The AIPmut population was predominantly young and male (63.5%); first symptoms occurred as children/adolescents in 50%.

Somatotropinomas comprised 78.1% of the cohort; there were also prolactinomas (n = 13), nonsecreting adenomas (n = 7), and a TSH-secreting adenoma. AIPmut somatotropinomas were larger (P = 0.00026), with higher GH levels (P = 0.00068), more frequent extension (P = 0.018) and prolactin cosecretion (P = 0.00023), and occurred 2 decades before controls (P < 0.000001). Gigantism was more common in the AIPmut group (P < 0.000001). AIPmut somatotropinoma patients underwent more surgical interventions (P = 0.00069) and had lower decreases in GH (P = 0.00037) and IGF-I (P = 0.028) and less tumor shrinkage with somatostatin analogs (P < 0.00001) vs. controls. AIPmut prolactinomas occurred generally in young males and frequently required surgery or radiotherapy.  AIPmut pituitary adenomas have clinical features that may negatively impact treatment efficacy. Predisposition for aggressive disease in young patients, often in a familial setting, suggests that earlier diagnosis of AIPmut pituitary adenomas may have clinical utility.

Endogenous hypercortisolism is usually due to ACTH-secreting pituitary corticotropic adenomas and less often due to ectopic ACTH-secreting neuroendocrine neoplasms or ACTH-independent adrenal cortisol hypersecretion. CS is a serious chronic disease leading to a several-fold increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Multiple genetic alterations have been described in the setting of sporadic corticotropinoma formation. Changes in the expression profiles have been demonstrated in growth factors and their receptors, cell-cycle regulators and in various genes related to hormonal gene transcription, synthesis and secretion. Sporadic adrenal adenomas and carcinomas may demonstrate dysfunction in genes such as TP53 among others. Cushing's disease can be an inherited condition also. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) together account for 5% of pituitary adenomas. Cushing's disease occurs infrequently in an inherited setting in both of these conditions. To date only 2 cases of Cushing's disease have been described in association with mutations in AIP. One case of Cushing's disease has been reported as part of MEN4, a rare MEN1-like syndrome due to mutation in the CDKN1B gene. Carney complex (CNC) due to PRKAR1A mutations in most cases is associated with CS, mainly as a cause of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. The cAMP signaling pathway is affected in this setting. In recent times the involvement of genes such as PDE11A, PDE8B and others have expanded the spectrum of the genetic pathophysiology of CS.""]"

Thus a heterogeneous population of cells appears in which the nonproductive plasmid-free cells overgrow the plasmid-bearing once. The main factors that influence plasmid segregational instability are: plasmid structure, plasmid copy number, host cell genotype, level of protein expression, fermentation conditions, etc. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of recombinant gene structure and level of expression on the segregation of expression plasmids based on pBR322. To this end the wild type human interferon gamma (hIFN gamma) gene and a series of seven derivative genes obtained by systemic 3'-end deletion were inserted into an expression plasmid under a strong constitutive promoter. The segregational instability was studied under batch fermentation conditions in non-selective Luria Bertani medium, where the cell cultures were maintained at an exponential growth phase. To describe the population dynamics, a mathematical model proposed by Stewart & Levin was used and the parameters Delta (difference in specific growth rate between plasmid-free and plasmid-harbouring cells) and theta (relative plasmid loss rate) were determined for each plasmid. The obtained results showed that any variation in the 3'-end of the hIFN gamma-gene strongly affected plasmid instability. We also found that the relative plasmid loss rate. was proportional to the hIFN gamma-mRNA content in the cell. Based on these results, we conclude that the structure of the constitutively expressed gene is of great importance for the segregational plasmid instability."", 'Segregation of expression plasmids leads to loss of recombinant DNA from transformed bacterial cells due to the irregular distribution of plasmids between the daughter cells during cell division. Under nonselective conditions this segregational instability results in a heterogeneous population of cells, where the nonproductive plasmid-free cells overgrow the plasmid-bearing cells thus decreasing the yield of recombinant protein. Amongst the factors affecting segregational plasmid instability are: the plasmid design, plasmid copy-number, host cell genotype, fermentation conditions etc. This study aims to investigate the influence of transcription and translation on the segregation of recombinant plasmids designed for constitutive gene expression in Escherichia coli LE392 at glucose-limited continuous cultivation. To this end a series of pBR322-based plasmids carrying a synthetic human interferon-gamma (hIFN gamma) gene placed under the control of different regulatory elements (promoter and ribosome-binding sites) were used as a model.  Bacterial growth and product formation kinetics of transformed E. coli LE392 cells cultivated continuously were described by a structured kinetic model proposed by Lee et al. (1985). The obtained results demonstrated that both transcription and translation efficiency strongly affected plasmid segregation. The segregation of plasmid having a deleted promoter did not exceed 5% after 190 h of cultivation. The observed high plasmid stability was not related with an increase in the plasmid copy-number. A reverse correlation between the yield of recombinant protein (as modulated by using different ribosome binding sites) and segregational plasmid stability (determined by the above model) was also observed.  Switching-off transcription of the hIFN gamma gene has a stabilising effect on ColE1-like plasmids against segregation, which is not associated with an increase in the plasmid copy-number. The increased constitutive gene expression has a negative effect on segregational plasmid stability. A kinetic model proposed by Lee et al. (1985) was appropriate for description of E. coli cell growth and recombinant product formation in chemostat cultivations.', ""Segregation of plasmids with relaxed control of replication is due to their non-random distribution between the daughter cells during cell division. Plasmid segregation is a biological phenomenon influenced by many factors like type of replicon, presence of partitioning elements, plasmid copy-number cultivation conditions, host genotype, etc. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of systematic changes in the human interferon-gamma (hIFN gamma) gene on the segregation of expression plasmids in E. coli cells. To this end a series of 3'-truncated hIFN gamma genes were cloned in a pBR322-based expression plasmid containing a strong constitutive promoter (T5P25) and a synthetic ribosome binding site. The series of plasmids thus constructed was transformed in E. coli LE392 cells and their segregation was investigated under batch fermentation conditions in non-selective Luria-Bertani medium.

To explain this influence the model parameters were compared with experimental data characterizing hIFN gamma gene expression such as yield of recombinant protein, hIFN gamma-mRNA and plasmid copy-number A clear correlation was found between the relative plasmid loss rate and hIFN gamma-mRNA content, which however was not associated with the plasmid copy-number value.""]"

The Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were explored for relevant articles in November 2009. Specificities, and negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and the TST, and the exposure gradient influences on test results among bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinees were evaluated.

When test performance of an immunodiagnostic test was not restricted to prior positivity of another test, progression rates to tuberculosis among IGRA-positive individuals followed for 19-24 months varied 8-15%, exceeding those reported for the TST (2-3%). Inmultivariate analyses, the odd ratios for TST positivity following BCG vaccination varied 3-25, whereas IGRA results remained uninfluenced and IGRA positivity was clearly associated with exposure to contagious tuberculosis cases.

To investigate factors influencing results of IFN-gamma release assays in children using a large European data set.  The Pediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials group pooled and analyzed data from five sites across Europe comprising 1,128 children who were all investigated for latent tuberculosis infection by tuberculin skin test and at least one IFN-gamma release assay. Multivariate analyses examined age, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status, and sex as predictor variables of results. Subgroup analyses included children who were household contacts. Measurements and Main  A total of 1,093 children had a QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay and 382 had a T-SPOT.TB IFN-gamma release assay. Age was positively correlated with a positive blood result (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube: odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per year increasing age [P < 0.0001]; T-SPOT.TB: OR, 1.14 per year increasing age [P < 0.001]). A positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube result was shown by 5.5% of children with a tuberculin skin test result less than 5 mm, by 14.8% if less than 10 mm, and by 20.2% if less than 15 mm. Prior BCG vaccination was associated with a negative IFN-gamma release assay result (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube: OR, 0.41 [P < 0.001]; T-SPOT.TB: OR, 0.41 [P < 0.001]). Young age was a predictor of indeterminate IFN-gamma release assay results, but indeterminate rates were low (3.6% in children < 5 yr, 1% in children > 5 yr).

This assay improves the synergy between clinical microbiology and epidemiology by providing (i) mutation-based prediction of drug resistance profiles for patient treatment and (ii) genotyping data for tuberculosis (TB) surveillance. This third-generation microbead-based high-throughput assay for TB runs on the Luminex 200 system and on the recently launched MagPix system (Luminex, Austin, TX). Spoligotyping patterns obtained by the TB-SPRINT method were 100% (n = 85 isolates; 3,655/3,655 spoligotype data points) concordant with those obtained by microbead-based and membrane-based spoligotyping. Genetic drug susceptibility typing provided by the TB-SPRINT method was 100% concordant with resistance locus sequencing (n = 162 for rpoB gene sequencing and n = 76 for katG and inhA sequencing). Considering phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) as the reference method, the sensitivity and specificity of TB-SPRINT regarding Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (n = 162 isolates) rifampin resistance were both 100%, and those for isoniazid resistance were 90.4% (95% confidence interval, 85 to 95%) and 100%, respectively. Used routinely in national TB reference and specialized laboratories, the TB-SPRINT assay should simultaneously improve personalized medicine and epidemiological surveillance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. This assay is expected to play an emerging role in public health in countries with heavy burdens of MDR TB and/or HIV/TB coinfection. Application of this assay directly to biological samples, as well as development for extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB detection by inclusion of second-line antituberculosis drug-associated mutations, is under development. With bioinformatical methods and data mining to reduce the number of targets to the most informative ones, locally adapted formats of this technique can easily be developed everywhere.']"

Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries are generally at less advanced stages of implementing HTA, which is particularly true for patient involvement activities. As part of the Horizon2020 HTx project, this research aimed to form recommendations for critical barriers to patient involvement in HTA in CEE countries. MethodsBuilt on previous research findings on potential barriers, a prioritisation survey was conducted online with CEE stakeholders. Recommendations for prioritised barriers were formed through a face-to-face workshop by CEE stakeholders and HTx experts. ResultsA total of 105 stakeholders from 13 CEE countries completed the prioritisation survey and identified 12 of the 22 potential barriers as highly important. The workshop had 36 participants representing 9 CEE countries, and 5 Western European countries coming together to discuss solutions in order to form recommendations based on best practices, real-life experience, and transferability aspects. Stakeholder groups involved in both phases included HTA organisation representatives, payers, patients, caregivers, patient organisation representatives, patient experts, health care providers, academic and non-academic researchers, health care consultants and health technology manufacturers/providers. As a result, 12 recommendations were formed specified to the CEE region's context, but potentially useful for a broader geographic audience. ConclusionIn this paper, we present 12 recommendations for meaningful, systematic, and sustainable patient involvement in HTA in CEE countries. Our hope is that engaging more than a hundred CEE stakeholders in the study helped to spread awareness of the importance and potential of patient involvement and that the resulting recommendations provide tangible steps for the way forward. Future studies shall focus on country-specific case studies of the implemented recommendations."", ""Cancer survival and stage of disease at diagnosis and treatment vary widely across Europe. These differences may be partly due to variations in access to investigations and specialists. However, evidence to explain how different national health systems influence primary care practitioners' (PCPs') referral decisions is lacking. This study analyses health system factors potentially influencing PCPs' referral decision-making when consulting with patients who may have cancer, and how these vary between European countries. Design Based on a content-validity consensus, a list of 45 items relating to a PCP's decisions to refer patients with potential cancer symptoms for further investigation was reduced to 20 items. An online questionnaire with the 20 items was answered by PCPs on a five-point Likert scale, indicating how much each item affected their own decision-making in patients that could have cancer. An exploratory factor analysis identified the factors underlying PCPs' referral decision-making. Setting A primary care study; 25 participating centres in 20 European countries. Participants 1830 PCPs completed the survey. The median response rate for participating centres was 20.7%. Outcome measures The factors derived from items related to PCPs' referral decision-making. Mean factor scores were produced for each country, allowing comparisons. Factor analysis identified five underlying factors: PCPs' ability to refer; degree of direct patient access to secondary care; PCPs' perceptions of being under pressure; expectations of PCPs' role; and extent to which PCPs believe that quality comes before cost in their health systems. These accounted for 47.4% of the observed variance between individual responses. Five healthcare system factors influencing PCPs' referral decision-making in 20 European countries were identified. The factors varied considerably between European countries. Knowledge of these factors could assist development of health service policies to produce better cancer outcomes, and inform future research to compare national cancer diagnostic pathways and outcomes."", 'BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has attracted much attention because of its enormous potential in healthcare, but uptake has been slow. There are substantial barriers that challenge health technology assessment (HTA) professionals to use AI-generated evidence for decision-making from large real-world databases (e.g., based on claims data). As part of the European Commission-funded HTx H2020 (Next Generation Health Technology Assessment) project, we aimed to put forward recommendations to support healthcare decision-makers in integrating AI into the HTA processes. The barriers, addressed by the paper, are particularly focusing on Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, where the implementation of HTA and access to health databases lag behind Western European countries. MethodsWe constructed a survey to rank the barriers to using AI for HTA purposes, completed by respondents from CEE jurisdictions with expertise in HTA. Using the results, two members of the HTx consortium from CEE developed recommendations on the most critical barriers. Then these recommendations were discussed in a workshop by a wider group of experts, including HTA and reimbursement decision-makers from both CEE countries and Western European countries, and summarized in a consensus report. ResultsRecommendations have been developed to address the top 15 barriers in areas of (1) human factor-related barriers, focusing on educating HTA doers and users, establishing collaborations and best practice sharing; (2) regulatory and policy-related barriers, proposing increasing awareness and political commitment and improving the management of sensitive information for AI use; (3) data-related barriers, suggesting enhancing standardization and collaboration with data networks, managing missing and unstructured data, using analytical and statistical approaches to address bias, using quality assessment tools and quality standards, improving reporting, and developing better conditions for the use of data; and (4) technological barriers, suggesting sustainable development of AI infrastructure. ConclusionIn the field of HTA, the great potential of AI to support evidence generation and evaluation has not yet been sufficiently explored and realized. Raising awareness of the intended and unintended consequences of AI-based methods and encouraging political commitment from policymakers is necessary to upgrade the regulatory and infrastructural environment and knowledge base required to integrate AI into HTA-based decision-making processes better.']"

This was a multicenter study from eight fetal medicine units in which the leadership were trained at the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine in London, UK, and in which the protocols for screening, invasive testing and pregnancy management are similar. Data were obtained prospectively from women with twin pregnancy undergoing routine ultrasound examination at 11-13 weeks' gestation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise elimination was used to examine whether CVS provided a significant independent contribution to the prediction of risk of fetal loss after adjusting for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, including maternal age, racial origin and weight, method of conception, smoking status, parity, chorionicity, intertwin discordance in CRL, fetal NT >= 95(th) percentile and free beta-hCG and PAPP-A multiples of the median. Similarly, within the CVS group, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the effect of the number of intrauterine needle insertions and size of the needle on the risk of fetal loss. The study population of 8581 twin pregnancies undergoing ultrasound examination at 11-13 weeks' gestation included 316 dichorionic and 129 monochorionic twins that had CVS. First, in twin pregnancies undergoing CVS, compared to those not undergoing CVS, there was a 2-fold increased risk of fetal loss at < 24 weeks' gestation and of loss at any stage in pregnancy. Second, the factors providing a significant independent contribution to the prediction of miscarriage or fetal loss in twin pregnancy were increased maternal weight, black racial origin, monochorionicity, and more so monoamnionicity, large intertwin discordance in CRL and increased fetal NT, and, in the case of fetal loss at any stage, there was also a contribution from assisted conception and low serum PAPP-A. Third, after adjustment for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, CVS did not provide a significant contribution to the risk of fetal loss. Fourth, in twin pregnancies that had CVS, there was no significant contribution to fetal loss from the number of intrauterine needle insertions or needle size. The 2-fold increased risk of fetal loss following CVS in twin pregnancy can, to a great extent, be explained by maternal and pregnancy characteristics rather than the invasive procedure itself.

However, in a subsequent validation study, we found that, in both the training and validation datasets, the observed incidence of PE was lower than the predicted one and such overestimation of risk was particularly marked for early PE. First, to develop a new extension of the competing-risks prior model in screening for PE by maternal demographic characteristics and medical history in twin pregnancies in a training dataset. Second, to examine the predictive performance of this model in screening for PE with delivery < 34 weeks (early PE), < 37 weeks (preterm PE) and at any gestational age (all PE) in twins in a validation dataset. Third, to demonstrate the application of screening in a mixed population of singleton and twin pregnancies. The data for this study were obtained from two prospective non-intervention multicenter screening studies for PE in twin pregnancies at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation. The training and validation datasets consisted of 2219 and 2999 women, respectively. We used the training dataset to fit a model in which the effect of twins on shifting the distribution of gestational age at delivery with PE in singletons to the left should not be the same for all gestational ages but the shift should depend on the singleton prior mean; the effect increases with increasing prior mean. We examined the predictive performance of the model in the training and validation datasets using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Data on 16 747 singleton pregnancies obtained from the Screening ProgRamme for prE-Eclampsia (SPREE) study were included to examine the performance of screening in a mixed population of singleton and twin pregnancies. Calibration plots and calibration intercept and slope demonstrate superior predictive performance of the new model in the validation dataset. Although the AUC for twin pregnancies is lower than in singleton pregnancies, performance of screening in a mixed population of singleton and twin pregnancies is superior to that in singletons (AUC of 0.790 in a mixed population comprising 2% twins and 98% singletons compared to 0.775 in singletons). For the risk cut-offs likely to be used in practice, all twin pregnancies screen positive using maternal characteristics and medical history. A new competing-risks model in screening for PE by maternal risk factors in twin pregnancy has been developed and, using this model, the predicted risks for early PE, preterm PE and all PE are in relatively good agreement with the observed incidence of the disease.

Two datasets of prospective non-intervention multicenter screening studies for PE in twin pregnancies at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation were used. The first dataset was from the EVENTS (Early vaginal progesterone for the preVention of spontaneous prEterm birth iN TwinS) trial and the second was from a previously reported study that examined the distributions of biomarkers in twin pregnancies. Maternal demographic characteristics and medical history from the EVENTS-trial dataset were used to assess the validity of risks from our previously developed model. The combined data from the first and second datasets were used to compare the distributional properties of logo multiples of the median (MoM) values of UtA-PI, MAP, PIGF and PAPP-A in twin pregnancies that delivered with PE to those in singleton pregnancies and develop new models based on these results. The competing-risks model was used to estimate the individual patient-specific risks of delivery with PE at < 32 and < 37 weeks' gestation. Screening performance was measured by detection rates (DR) and areas under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve. The EVENTS-trial dataset comprised 1798 pregnancies, including 168 (9.3%) that developed PE. In the validation of the prior model based on maternal characteristics and medical history, calibration plots demonstrated very good agreement between the predicted risks and the observed incidence of PE (calibration slope and intercept for PE < 32 weeks were 0.827 and 0.009, respectively, and for PE < 37 weeks they were 0.942 and -0.207, respectively). In the combined data, there were 3938 pregnancies, including 339 (8.6%) that developed PE and 253 (6.4%) that delivered with PE at < 37 weeks' gestation. In twin pregnancies that delivered with PE, MAP, UtA-PI and PIGF were, at earlier gestational ages, more discriminative than in singleton pregnancies and at later gestational ages they were less so. For PAPP-A, there was little difference between PE and unaffected pregnancies. The best performance of screening for PE was achieved by a combination of maternal factors, MAP, UtA-PI and PIGF. In screening by maternal factors alone, the DR, at a 10% false-positive rate, was 30.6% for delivery with PE at < 32 weeks' gestation and this increased to 86.4% when screening by the combined test; the respective values for PE < 37 weeks were 24.9% and 41.1%. In the assessment of risk for PE in twin pregnancy, we can use the same prior model based on maternal characteristics and medical history as reported previously, but in the calculation of posterior risks it is necessary to use the new distributions of log(10) MoM values of UtA-PI, MAP and PIGF according to gestational age at delivery with PE.""]"

MethodsWe combined bioinformatical and molecular methods to identify miRNAs with possible clinical significance as biomarkers in OSCC. A set of 10 miRNAs were selected via an in silico approach by analysing the 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of cancer-related mRNAs such as FLRT2, NTRK3, and SLC8A1, TFCP2L1 and etc. RT-qPCR was used to compare the expression of in silico identified miRNAs in OSCC and normal tissues (n=32).

Initial stage tumors (T1, T2) expressed significantly higher levels of miR-133b (p < 0.0004) compared to more advanced ones (T3, T4).

The high expression of these 6 miRNAs as a signature predicted shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and could efficiently distinguish OSCC cases from healthy controls with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 with sensitivity and specificity of 0.98 and 0.6, respectively. Further target identification analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in FOXO, longevity, glycan biosynthesis and p53 cancer-related signaling pathways.

Ten miRNAs were validated in the LUSC group: 3 upregulated - miR-7-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-650, and 7 downregulated - miR-95-5p, miR-140-3p, miR-144-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-375, miR-744-3p, and miR-4689-3p. Reactome pathway analysis revealed that the target genes of the deregulated miRNAs in LUAD were significantly enriched in cell cycle, membrane trafficking, gene expression processes, and EGFR signaling, while in LUSC, they were enriched in the immune system, transcriptional regulation by TP53, and FGFR signaling. This study identified distinct miRNA profiles in LUSC and LUAD, which are common and specific miRNAs that could be further investigated as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.']"

We hypothesized that areas demonstrating differential activation in two groups of patients (the first group exhibiting paranoid delusions in the context of paranoid schizophrenia-SCH-and second group with a depressive episode in the context of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder-DEP) will have distinct connectivity patterns and structural differences. Fifty-one patients with SCH (n = 25) or DEP (n = 26) were scanned with three different MRI sequences: a structural and two functional sequences-resting-state and task-related fMRI (the stimuli represent items from a paranoid-depressive self-evaluation scale). While no significant differences were found in gray matter volumes, we were able to discriminate between the two clinical entities by identifying two significant clusters of activations in the SCH group-the left Precuneus (PreCu) extending to the left Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) and the right Angular Gyrus (AG). Additionally, the effective connectivity of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), a part of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) to the Anterior Insula (AI), demonstrated a significant difference between the two groups with inhibitory connection demonstrated only in SCH. The observed activations of PreCu, PCC, and AG (involved in the Default Mode Network DMN) might be indirect evidence of the inhibitory connection from the DLPFC to AI, interfering with the balancing function of the insula as the dynamic switch in the DMN. The findings of our current study might suggest that the connectivity from DLPFC to the anterior insula can be interpreted as evidence for the presence of an aberrant network that leads to behavioral abnormalities, the manifestation of which depends on the direction of influence. The reduced effective connectivity from the AI to the DLPFC is manifested as depressive symptoms, and the inhibitory effect from the DLPFC to the AI is reflected in the paranoid symptoms of schizophrenia.', '&  We have previously identified aberrant connectivity of the left precuneus, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior insula in patients with either a paranoid (schizophrenia), or a depressive syndrome (both unipolar and bipolar). In the current study, we attempted to replicate and expand these findings by including a healthy control sample and separating the patients in a depressive episode into two groups: unipolar and bipolar depression. We hypothesized that the connections between those major nodes of the resting state networks would demonstrate different patterns in the three patient groups compared to the healthy subjects.  Resting-state functional MRI was performed on a sample of 101 participants, of which 26 patients with schizophrenia (current psychotic episodes), 24 subjects with Bipolar Disorder (BD), 33 with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (both BD and MDD patients were in a current depressive episode), and 21 healthy controls. Spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling was used to calculate the coupling values between eight regions of interest, including the anterior precuneus (PRC), anterior hippocampus, anterior insula, angular gyrus, lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC), middle frontal gyrus, planum temporale, and anterior thalamus. &  We identified disturbed effective connectivity from the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex to the left anterior precuneus that differed significantly between unipolar depression, where the influence was inhibitory, and bipolar depression, where the effect was excitatory. A logistic regression analysis correctly classified 75% of patients with unipolar and bipolar depression based solely on the coupling values of this connection. In addition, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated negative effective connectivity from the anterior PRC to the lateral OFC, which distinguished them from healthy controls and patients with major depression. Future studies with unmedicated patients will be needed to establish the replicability of our findings.', 'Schizophrenia is a mental illness with diverse clinical presentation, in which a significant proportion of patients show resistance to treatment. In patients with schizophrenia, symptoms from all psychotic and affective spectra are observed. On the one hand, affective symptoms determine the clinical course of schizophrenia and on the other hand, depressive symptoms are some of the most common ones in psychiatry in general. These data give us reason to explore the impact of depressive symptoms on the course of schizophrenia and its relationship with resistance to treatment. Method: A study of 105 patients with schizophrenia was performed. Of these, 39 were male and 66 were female. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment carried out at 12 weeks of therapy showed that 45 were resistant to schizophrenia and the remaining 60 were in clinical remission. The clinical evaluation of the patients was performed with the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) scales. The assessment of depressive complaints was conducted with the Hamilton Depression Scale.  Our study showed that in the analysis of depressive complaints with the Hamilton scale females got 12.55 points, and males got 11.44 points. We found a correlation of depressive complaints with the evaluation on the PANSS and BPRS scales, and in the analysis on the individual subscales we found a correlation on the subscale for positive and disorganized symptoms and no correlation on the scale for negative symptoms. We established a difference in the level of depression in patients with resistance in whom the level of depressive complaints was 13.82, while in those in clinical remission it was 10.87 points.  The level of depressive symptoms in patients with resistant schizophrenia is higher than in clinical remission. Depressive symptoms correlate with positive and disorganized symptoms on the PANSS scale, but not with negative symptoms. Gender is not a determining factor in depressive complaints.']"

The luminescence of these materials is due to a rare photophysical phenomenon called antenna effect, in which the excited ligand transmits its energy to the emitting levels of the metal. However, despite the attractive photophysical properties and the intriguing from a fundamental point of view antenna effect, the theoretical molecular design of new luminescent metal-organic complexes of rare earth metals is relatively limited. Our computational study aims to contribute in this direction, and we model the excited state properties of four new phenanthroline-based complexes of Eu(III) using the TD-DFT/TDA approach. The general formula of the complexes is EuL(2)A(3), where L is a phenanthroline with -2-CH3O-C6H4, -2-HO-C6H4, -C6H5 or -O-C6H5 substituent at position 2 and A is Cl- or NO3-. The antenna effect in all newly proposed complexes is estimated as viable and is expected to possess luminescent properties. The relationship between the electronic properties of the isolated ligands and the luminescent properties of the complexes is explored in detail. Qualitative and quantitative models are derived to interpret the ligand-to-complex relation, and the results are benchmarked with respect to available experimental data. Based on the derived model and common molecular design criteria for efficient antenna ligands, we choose phenanthroline with -O-C6H5 substituent to perform complexation with Eu(III) in the presence of NO3 over bar . Experimental results for the newly synthesized Eu(III) complex are reported with a luminescent quantum yield of about 24% in acetonitrile. The study demonstrates the potential of low-cost computational models for discovering metal-organic luminescent materials.', ""Gallium (III) complexes with the ligands 5-bromosalicylaldehyde-4-hydroxybenzoylhydrazone and 5-bromosalicylaldehyde isonicotinoylhydrazone were synthesized to receive compounds with improved antiproliferative action. Compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, and NMR spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations with Becke's 3-parameter hybrid functional and 6-31+G(d,p) basis set were carried out to investigate the structural features of the ligands and Ga(III) complexes. Cytotoxic screening by MTT-dye reduction assay was carried out using cisplatin and melphalan as reference cytotoxic agents. A general formula [Ga(HL)(2)]NO3 for the complexes obtained was suggested. The complexes are mononuclear with the Ga(III) ions being surrounded by two ligands. The ligands acted as monoanionic tridentate (ONO) donor molecules. The analysis revealed coordination binding through deprotonated phenolic-oxygen, azomethine-nitrogen, and amide-oxygen atoms. The bioassay demonstrated that all compounds exhibited concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity at low micromolar concentrations against the acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 and T-cell leukemia SKW-3 cell lines. IC50 values of 5-bromo-derivative ligands and gallium (III) complexes are lower than those of cisplatin and much lower than these of melphalan. The coordination to gallium (III) additionally increased the cytotoxicity compared to the metal-free hydrazones."", 'Tackling antimicrobial resistance is of increasing concern in a post-pandemic world where overuse of antibiotics has increased the threat of another pandemic caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

The experimental spectroscopic data were then interpreted on the basis of molecular structure modelling and subsequent spectra simulation using the density functional theory method to identify the coordination mode in solution for the metal ions in the complexes. Interestingly, the solid-state coordination environment of the zinc complexes is in good agreement with the simulated solution state, which has not been the case in our previous studies of these ligands when coordinated to silver(I). Previous studies had indicated excellent antimicrobial activity for Ag(I) analogues of these ligands and related copper and zinc complexes of coumarin-derived ligands, but in this study none of the complexes displayed antimicrobial activity against the clinically relevant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.']"

(EAM) against in-vitro/in-vivo carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage in rats. Silymarin was used as a positive control. and results: The in-vitro experiments were carried out in primary isolated rat hepatocytes first incubated with CCl4 (86 mu mol/l). Hepatic injury was discerned by a decrease in cell viability and cell glutathione (GSH) levels, an increase in lactate dehydrogenase leakage into the medium, and an elevation in malondialdehyde (MDA) quantity. Cell pre-incubation with EAM (1 mu g/ml and 10 mu g/ml) significantly ameliorated the CCl4-induced liver damage. In-vivo rats were challenged orally with CCl4 (10% solution in olive oil) alone and after 7 days pre-treatment with EAM (100 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage). CCl4 damage was judged by an increased production of MDA, depletion of cell GSH, and a decrease in cell antioxidant defense system. EAM pre-treatment normalizes the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and the levels of GSH and MDA. These data are supported by the histopathological examination.  These results indicate that EAM has a similar significant protective effect, in vitro and in vivo, against CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in rat as silymarin. This may be due to its antioxidant and membrane stabilizing properties.', 'The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of fluoxetine in carrageenan- and lipoplysaccharide-induced models of inflammation by investigating the changes in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta after single and repeated administration of the drug. To study the effect of a single and repeated dose fluoxetine on carrageenan-induced paw edema male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 8): control group; positive control group; and three experimental groups treated with 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) fluoxetine, respectively. To study the effect of a single and repeated dose of fluoxetine on serum cytokine levels, the animals were divided in four groups (n = 8): two control groups treated with saline and two experimental groups treated with fluoxetine 20 mg/kg bw. Carrageenan and LPS were injected immediately after fluoxetine or saline injection. Serum cytokine concentrations were tested by enzyme immunoassay. In single administration only the highest dose used inhibited carrageenan-induced inflammation. Edema inhibition was seen with 10 and 20 mg/kg bw fluoxetine after repeated administration. At 24 h a statistically significant effect on inhibition of carrageenan edema was found only in rats treated with 20 mg/kg bw fluoxetine In carrageenan-induced inflammation, fluoxetine significantly increased Il-10 and decreased TNF-alpha after repeated administration. Surprisingly, in single-dose treated animals an increase in TNF-alpha values upon fluoxetine administration was observed in this model of inflammation. In LPS-induced inflammation, fluoxetine significantly decreased TNF-alpha after single and repeated treatment. Fluoxetine has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect in the carrageenan-induced model of exudative inflammation. In LPS-induced inflammation it showed an immunomodulatory effect manifested with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha.', 'The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of clomipramine in carrageenan- and lipopolysaccharide-induced (LPS-induced) models of inflammation by investigating the changes in serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta after single and repeated administration of the drug.

The effect of single and repeated doses of clomipramine on serum cytokine levels was studied as animals were divided in four groups: two control groups treated with saline and two experimental groups treated with clomipramine 20 mg/kg bw. Carrageenan and LPS were injected immediately after clomipramine or saline injection. Serum cytokine concentrations were tested by enzyme immunoassay. Following acute administration only the highest dose that was used inhibited the carrageenan-induced inflammation. Oedema inhibition was observed with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg bw clomipramine after repeated administration. Single and repeated administration of clomipramine at a dose of 20 mg/kg bw did not significantly change the serum levels of TGF-1 beta, IL-10 and TNF-alpha when compared to the controls in carrageenan-induced inflammation. Following LPS-induced inflammation clomipramine significantly increased the serum levels of TGF-1 beta after repeated administration and decreased TNF-alpha in rats after single-dose and repeated pretreatment with 20 mg/kg bw clomipramine. A significant increase in the levels of IL-10 in relation to this inflammatory model was observed only in single dose treated animals. Clomipramine possesses an anti-inflammatory effect in the carrageenan-induced model of exudative inflammation. In LPS-induced inflammation, clomipramine showed an immunomodulatory effect, decreasing TNF-alpha and increasing TGF-1 beta after repeated administration, and increasing IL-10 after a single dose.']"

To maintain operational capability and provide training, RENEB runs regular inter-laboratory comparison (ILC) exercises. The RENEB ILC2021 was carried out with all the biological and physical dosimetry assays employed in the network. The focus of this paper is to evaluate the results from 6 laboratories that took part using the gamma-H2AX radiation-induced foci assay. For two laboratories this was their first RENEB ILC. Blood samples were homogenously exposed to 240 kVp X rays (1 Gy/min) to provide calibration data, (0-4 Gy), and a few weeks later three blind coded test samples, (0, 1.2 and 3.5 Gy) were prepared. All samples were allowed a 2 h repair time at 37 degrees C before being transported, on ice packs, to the participating laboratories. On arrival, the samples were processed, scored either manually or automatically for gamma-H2AX foci and dose estimates for the 3 blind coded samples sent to the organizing laboratory. The temperature of samples during transit and the time taken to report the dose estimates were recorded. Subsequent examination of the data from each laboratory used the doses estimates to assign triage categories to the samples. After receipt of the samples, the quickest report of dose estimates was 4.6 h. Analysis of variance revealed that the laboratory carrying out the assay had a significant effect on the foci yield (P < 0.001) for the calibration data, but not on the dose estimates of the blind coded samples (P = 0.101). All laboratories correctly identified the unirradiated and irradiated samples, although the dose estimates for the latter tended to under-estimate the dose. Two participants seriously under-estimated the dose for the highly exposed sample, which resulted in the sample being placed in the lowest triage category not the highest. However, this under-estimation resulted from the samples not remaining cold during shipment, due to a delay in transit and was not related to the experience of the participating laboratory. Overall, the RENEB network laboratories have demonstrated it is possible to quickly identify a recent whole-body acute exposure using the gamma-H2AX assay within the conditions of the ILC. In addition, an ILC provides a useful training and harmonization exercise for laboratories. (c) 2023 by Radiation Research Society', 'Tools for radiation exposure reconstruction are required to support the medical management of radiation victims in radiological or nuclear incidents. Different biological and physical dosimetry assays can be used for various exposure scenarios to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation a person has absorbed. Regular validation of the techniques through inter-laboratory comparisons (ILC) is essential to guarantee high quality results. In the current RENEB inter-laboratory comparison, the performance quality of established cytogenetic assays [dicentric chromosome assay (DCA), cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN), stable chromosomal translocation assay (FISH) and premature chromosome condensation assay (PCC)] was tested in comparison to molecular biological assays [gamma-H2AX foci (gH2AX), gene expression (GE)] and physical dosimetry-based assays [electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), optically or thermally stimulated luminescence (LUM)]. Three blinded coded samples (e.g., blood, enamel or mobiles) were exposed to 0, 1.2 or 3.5 Gy X-ray reference doses (240 kVp, 1 Gy/min). These doses roughly correspond to clinically relevant groups of unexposed to low exposed (0-1 Gy), moderately exposed (1-2 Gy, no severe acute health effects expected) and highly exposed individuals (>2 Gy, requiring early intensive medical care). In the frame of the current RENEB inter-laboratory comparison, samples were sent to 86 specialized teams in 46 organizations from 27 nations for dose estimation and identification of three clinically relevant groups. The time for sending early crude reports and more precise reports was documented for each laboratory and assay where possible. The quality of dose estimates was analyzed with three different levels of granularity, 1. by calculating the frequency of correctly reported clinically relevant dose categories, 2. by determining the number of dose estimates within the uncertainty intervals recommended for triage dosimetry (+/- 0.5 Gy or +/- 1.0 Gy for doses < 2.5 Gy or > 2.5 Gy), and 3. by calculating the absolute difference (AD) of estimated doses relative to the reference doses. In total, 554 dose estimates were submitted within the 6-week period given before the exercise was closed. For samples processed with the highest priority, earliest dose estimates/categories were reported within 5-10 h of receipt for GE, gH2AX, LUM, EPR, 2-3 days for DCA, CBMN and within 6-7 days for the FISH assay. For the unirradiated control sample, the categorization in the correct clinically relevant group (0-1 Gy) as well as the allocation to the triage uncertainty interval was, with the exception of a few outliers, successfully performed for all assays. For the 3.5 Gy sample the percentage of correct classifications to the clinically relevant group (>= 2 Gy) was between 89-100% for all assays, with the exception of gH2AX. For the 1.2 Gy sample, an exact allocation to the clinically relevant group was more difficult and 0-50% or 0-48% of the estimates were wrongly classified into the lowest or highest dose categories, respectively. For the irradiated samples, the correct allocation to the triage uncertainty intervals varied considerably between assays for the 1.2 Gy (29-76%) and 3.5 Gy (17-100%) samples. While a systematic shift towards higher doses was observed for the cytogenetic-based assays, extreme outliers exceeding the reference doses 2-6 fold were observed for EPR, FISH and GE assays. These outliers were related to a particular material examined (tooth enamel for EPR assay, reported as kerma in enamel, but when converted into the proper quantity, i.e. to kerma in air, expected dose estimates could be recalculated in most cases), the level of experience of the teams (FISH) and methodological uncertainties (GE). This was the first RENEB ILC where everything, from blood sampling to irradiation and shipment of the samples, was organized and realized at the same institution, for several biological and physical retrospective dosimetry assays. Almost all assays appeared comparably applicable for the identification of unexposed and highly exposed individuals and the allocation of medical relevant groups, with the latter requiring medical support for the acute radiation scenario simulated in this exercise. However, extreme outliers or a systematic shift of dose estimates have been observed for some assays. Possible reasons will be discussed in the assay specific papers of this special issue. In summary, this ILC clearly demonstrates the need to conduct regular exercises to identify research needs, but also to identify technical problems and to optimize the design of future ILCs. (c) 2023 by Radiation Research Society', 'After large-scale radiation accidents where many individuals are suspected to be exposed to ionizing radiation, biological and physical retrospective dosimetry assays are important tools to aid clinical decision making by categorizing individuals into unexposed/minimally, moderately or highly exposed groups. Quality-controlled inter-laboratory comparisons of simulated accident scenarios are regularly performed in the frame of the European legal association RENEB (Running the European Network of Biological and Physical retrospective Dosimetry) to optimize international networking and emergency readiness in case of large-scale radiation events. In total 33 laboratories from 22 countries around the world participated in the current RENEB inter-laboratory comparison 2021 for the dicentric chromosome assay. Blood was irradiated in vitro with X rays (240 kVp, 13 mA, similar to 75 keV, 1 Gy/min) to simulate an acute, homogeneous whole-body exposure. Three blood samples (no. 1: 0 Gy, no. 2: 1.2 Gy, no. 3: 3.5 Gy) were sent to each participant and the task was to culture samples, to prepare slides and to assess radiation doses based on the observed dicentric yields from 50 manually or 150 semi-automatically scored metaphases (triage mode scoring). Approximately two-thirds of the participants applied calibration curves from irradiations with gamma rays and about 1/3 from irradiations with X rays with varying energies. The categorization of the samples in clinically relevant groups corresponding to individuals that were unexposed/minimally (0-1 Gy), moderately (1-2 Gy) or highly exposed (>2 Gy) was successfully performed by all participants for sample no. 1 and no. 3 and by >= 74% for sample no. 2. However, while most participants estimated a dose of exactly 0 Gy for the sham-irradiated sample, the precise dose estimates of the samples irradiated with doses > 0 Gy were systematically higher than the corresponding reference doses and showed a median deviation of 0.5 Gy (sample no. 2) and 0.95 Gy (sample no. 3) for manual scoring. By converting doses estimated based on gamma-ray calibration curves to X-ray doses of a comparable mean photon energy as used in this exercise, the median deviation decreased to 0.27 Gy (sample no. 2) and 0.6 Gy (sample no. 3). The main aim of biological dosimetry in the case of a large-scale event is the categorization of individuals into clinically relevant groups, to aid clinical decision making. This task was successfully performed by all participants for the 0 Gy and 3.5 Gy samples and by 74% (manual scoring) and 80% (semi-automatic scoring) for the 1.2 Gy sample. Due to the accuracy of the dicentric chromosome assay and the high number of participating laboratories, a systematic shift of the dose estimates could be revealed. Differences in radiation quality (X ray vs. gamma ray) between the test samples and the applied dose effect curves can partly explain the systematic shift. There might be several additional reasons for the observed bias (e.g., donor effects, transport, experimental conditions or the irradiation setup) and the analysis of these reasons provides great opportunities for future research. The participation of laboratories from countries around the world gave the opportunity to compare the results on an international level. (c) 2023 by Radiation Research Society']"

The majority of studies have presented experiences related to the negative effects of chronic pain affecting the individual and all aspects of life- experiences related to: 1) the dominant role of pain; 2) the invisibility of pain; 3) the change or loss of identity and the sense of self; 4) loss of social identity; 5) seeking help. Discussion: Qualitative research has provided particular insight into the multidimensional experience of pain. The selected qualitative studies reveal topics that determine the essence and significance of pain as a phenomenon. Some poorly explored areas are the impact of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, the perception of pain situation, the intensity of pain, memories of past experiences.

The mean age of the sample was 51.90 (SD=11.94). Women predominate (81.7%) over men (18.3%). The group with depression had a high degree of state and trait anxiety and moderate pain intensity. The content-analysis revealed that the experience of pain as punishment was specific for patients with depression. The reduction of the mean value of the severity of depression from moderate to mild in the second stage influenced the dynamics of the pain experiences in the direction of a limitation.

In this respect, the investigation of mechanical properties and stability of lipid membranes provides a useful background for advancement in pharmacological applications of liposomes. Here we probed the effect of the endogenous heptapeptide VV-hemorphin-5 (valorphin) on the bending elasticity of biomimetic lipid membranes of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) by analysis of thermal shape fluctuations of nearly spherical giant unilamellar vesicles. In a wide concentration range covering valorphin concentrations applied in nociceptive screening in vivo, we report alterations of the bilayer bending rigidity in a concentration-dependent non-monotonic manner. We performed quantitative characterization of VV-hemorphin-5 association to POPC membranes by isothermal titration calorimetry in order to shed light on the partitioning of the amphiphilic hemorphin between the aqueous solution and membranes. The calorimetric results correlate with flicker spectroscopy findings and support the hypothesis about the strength of valorphin-membrane interaction related to the peptide bulk concentration. A higher strength of valorphin interaction with the bilayer corresponds to a more pronounced effect of the peptide on the membrane's mechanical properties. The presented study features the comprehensive analysis of membrane bending elasticity as a biomarker for physicochemical effects of peptides on lipid bilayers. The reported data on thermodynamic parameters of valorphin interactions with phosphatidylcholine bilayers and alterations of their mechanical properties is expected to be useful for applications of lipid membrane systems in pharmacology and biomedicine."", 'Resveratrol (Resv) is considered to exert a beneficial impact due to its radical scavenger, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties through several mechanisms that could include its interaction with the cell plasma membrane. To address this issue, we investigated the influence of Resv on membrane lipid order and organization in large unilamellar vesicles composed of different lipids and ratios. The studied lipid membrane models were composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) species (either palmitoyl-docosahexaenoyl phosphatidylcholine (PDPC) or palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC)), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Chol). This study found that the addition of Resv resulted in complex membrane reorganization depending on the degree of fatty acid unsaturation at the sn-2 position, and the Lipid/Resv and SM/Chol ratios. Resv rigidified POPC-containing membranes and increased liquid-ordered (Lo) domain formation in 40/40/20 POPC/SM/Chol mixtures as this increase was lower at a 33/33/34 ratio. In contrast, Resv interacted with PDPC/SM/Chol mixtures in a bimodal manner by fluidizing/rigidifying the membranes in a dose-dependent way. Lo domain formation upon Resv addition occurred via the following bimodal mode of action: Lo domain size increased at low Resv concentrations; then, Lo domain size decreased at higher ones. To account for the variable effect of Resv, we suggest that it may act as a spacer at low doses, with a transition to a more filler position in the lipid bulk. We hypothesize that one of the roles of Resv is to tune the lipid order and organization of cell plasma membranes, which is closely linked to important cell functions such as membrane sorting and trafficking.', 'The phytoalexin resveratrol has received increasing attention for its potential to prevent oxidative damages in human organism. To shed further light on molecular mechanisms of its interaction with lipid membranes we study resveratrol influence on the organisation and mechanical properties of biomimetic lipid systems composed of synthetic phosphatidylcholines with mixed aliphatic chains and different degree of unsaturation at sn-2 position (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC, and 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine, PDPC). High-sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetric measurements reveal stronger spontaneous resveratrol association to polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine bilayers compared to the monounsaturated ones resulting from hydrophobic interactions, conformational changes of the interacting species and desolvation of molecular surfaces. The latter is supported by the results from Laurdan spectroscopy of large unilamellar vesicles providing data on hydration at the glycerol backbones of glycerophospholipides. Higher degree of lipid order is reported for POPC membranes compared to PDPC. While resveratrol mostly enhances the hydration of PDPC membranes, increasing POPC dehydration is reported upon treatment with the polyphenol. Dehydration of the polyunsaturated lipid bilayers is measured only at the highest phytoalexin content studied (resveratrol/lipid 0.5 mol/mol) and is less pronounced than the effect reported for POPC membranes. The polyphenol effect on membrane mechanics is probed by thermal shape fluctuation analysis of quasispherical giant unilamellar vesicles. Markedly different trend of the bending elasticity with increasing resveratrol concentration is reported for the two types of phospholipid bilayers studied. POPC membranes become more rigid in the presence of resveratrol, whereas PDPC-containing bilayers exhibit softening at lower concentrations of the polyphenol followed by a slight growth without bilayer stiffening even at the highest resveratrol content explored. The new data on the structural organization and membrane properties of resveratrol-treated phosphatidylcholine membranes may underpin the development of future liposomal applications of the polyphenol in medicinal chemistry.']"

This was followed by the World Health Organization's (WHO) global targets for the care and management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. These announcements and targets were important in raising awareness and calling for action; however, tracking countries' progress towards these elimination goals has provided insights to the limitations of these targets. The existing targets compare a country's progress relative to its 2015 values, penalizing countries who started their programmes prior to 2015, countries with a young population, or countries with a low prevalence. We recommend that (1) WHO simplify the hepatitis elimination targets, (2) change to absolute targets and (3) allow countries to achieve these disease targets with their own service coverage initiatives that will have the maximum impact. The recommended targets are as follows: reduce HCV new chronic cases to <= 5 per 100 000, reduce HBV prevalence among 1-year-olds to <= 0.1%, reduce HBV and HCV mortality to <= 5 per 100 000, and demonstrate HBV and HCV year-to-year decrease in new HCV- and HBV-related HCC cases. The objective of our recommendations is not to lower expectations or diminish the hepatitis elimination standards, but to provide clearer targets that recognize the past and current elimination efforts by countries, help measure progress towards true elimination, and motivate other countries to follow suit."", 'Diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection particularly its occult form requires monitoring and repeat serological and molecular studies. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible relation between the case of a family outbreak of hepatitis A and the finding that a member of this family was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. Methodology: A mother and her two sons, one previously diagnosed with chronic HBV infection, were hospitalized due to suspected acute hepatitis. Serological markers for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were assessed. Additionally, HBV DNA was tested with a sensitive PCR. Hepatitis B vaccine was administered to the mother to differentiate resolved from occult HBV infection.  A family outbreak of hepatitis A was confirmed, alongside a focus of chronic HBV infection. The serological profile for two brothers was HBsAg(+), anti-HBcIgM(-), anti-HBc(+), HBcAg(-)/anti-HBe(+). The mother was negative for all HBV markers except anti-HBc. HBV DNA was detected at a level of 461 IU/mL in the elder brother, 3647 IU/mL in the younger brother and was negative in the mother on two occasions. Her anti-HBc alone, having two sons with chronic HBV infection, and her lack of antibody response to hepatitis B vaccine despite being negative for HBV DNA, led to the diagnosis of probable occult HBV infection.  Our results confirmed that a vaccination approach could facilitate diagnosis of chronic HBV infection in the presence of isolated anti-HBc. If it were not for a family outbreak of hepatitis A, this unexpected family HBV focus would not have been revealed.', '&  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a nucleotide analogue and potent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase, showed superior efficacy to adefovir dipivoxil in treatment of chronic hepatitis B through 48 weeks. We evaluated long-term efficacy and safety of TDF monotherapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B who were positive or negative for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg+ or HBeAg-).  After 48 weeks of double-blind comparison of TDF to adefovir dipivoxil, patients who underwent liver biopsy were eligible to continue the study on open-label TDF for 7 additional years; data presented were collected up to 3 years (week 144) from 85% of participants. Primary efficacy end points at week 144 included levels of HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase, development of resistance mutations, and presence of HBeAg or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).  At week 144, 87% of HBeAg- and 72% of HBeAg+ patients treated with TDF had levels of HBV DNA <400 copies/mL. Among patients who had previously received adefovir dipivoxil and then received TDF, 88% of the HBeAg- and 71% of the HBeAg+ patients had levels of HBV DNA <400 copies/mL; overall, 81% and 74%, respectively, maintained normalized levels of alanine aminotransferase and 34% had lost HBeAg. Amino acid substitutions in HBV DNA polymerase that are associated with resistance to tenofovir were not detected in any patient. Cumulatively, 8% of HBeAg+ patients lost HBsAg. TDF maintained a favorable safety profile for up to 3 years.  TDF was safe and effective in the long-term management of HBeAg+ and HBeAg- patients with chronic hepatitis B.']"

Procedures and Outcomes Overweight/obese adults in 8 European countries who lost >= 8% of initial body-weight (BW) after following a low calorie diet (LCD) were later randomly assigned with a 2x2 factorial design into 4 ad libitum dietary groups with two different protein content levels and dissimilar glycemic index, which were compared to a healthy reference diet. Specific markers assessing insulin resistance were measured. The LCD was initially applied to 932 adults and 773 were randomised to the 5 ad libitum diets. The 6-months programme was completed by 548 participants. The assignment to the Low Protein/High Glycemic Index diet induced a statistically higher HOMA-IR increase during the 6 months period as compared to the control. Contrariwise, the insulin response was lower in the High Protein/Low Glycemic Index diet after 60 and 90 min of an Oral Glucose Tolerance test subsequently carried out after the 6-months intervention. The Low Glycemic Index diets (either with high or low protein content) also lead to a decrease in fructosamine levels during the trial. Conclusion/Interpretation After a weight loss period, an increase in the dietary protein proportions and a decrease in the consumption of foods with a high Glycemic Index within an ad libitum dietary intervention aiming to weight maintenance produced favorable effects on glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in overweight/obese subjects.', 'Studies of weight-control diets that are high in protein or low in glycemic index have reached varied conclusions, probably owing to the fact that the studies had insufficient power.  We enrolled overweight adults from eight European countries who had lost at least 8% of their initial body weight with a 3.3-MJ (800-kcal) low-calorie diet. Participants were randomly assigned, in a two-by-two factorial design, to one of five ad libitum diets to prevent weight regain over a 26-week period: a low-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a low-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, or a control diet.  A total of 1209 adults were screened (mean age, 41 years; body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 34), of whom 938 entered the low-calorie-diet phase of the study. A total of 773 participants who completed that phase were randomly assigned to one of the five maintenance diets; 548 completed the intervention (71%). Fewer participants in the high-protein and the low-glycemic-index groups than in the low-protein-high-glycemic-index group dropped out of the study (26.4% and 25.6%, respectively, vs. 37.4%; P=0.02 and P=0.01 for the respective comparisons). The mean initial weight loss with the low-calorie diet was 11.0 kg. In the analysis of participants who completed the study, only the low-protein-high-glycemic-index diet was associated with subsequent significant weight regain (1.67 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 2.87). In an intention-to-treat analysis, the weight regain was 0.93 kg less (95% CI, 0.31 to 1.55) in the groups assigned to a high-protein diet than in those assigned to a low-protein diet (P=0.003) and 0.95 kg less (95% CI, 0.33 to 1.57) in the groups assigned to a low-glycemic-index diet than in those assigned to a high-glycemic-index diet (P=0.003). The analysis involving participants who completed the intervention produced similar results. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to diet-related adverse events.  In this large European study, a modest increase in protein content and a modest reduction in the glycemic index led to an improvement in study completion and maintenance of weight loss.

Weight loss (-11.23 kg; 95% confidence interval, -11.54 to -10.92; P<0.001) reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-1.15 mg/L; 95% confidence interval, -1.30 to -0.41; P<0.001), low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. During the 26-week weight maintenance period in the intention-to-treat analysis, the further decrease of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein blood levels was -0.46 mg/L greater (95% confidence interval, -0.79 to -0.13) in the groups assigned to low-glycemic-index diets than in those on high-glycemic-index diets (P<0.001). Groups on low-protein diets achieved a -0.25 mg/L greater reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (95% confidence interval, -0.59 to -0.17) than those on high-protein diets (P<0.001), whereas lipid profiles and blood pressure were not differently affected. Conclusions-This large-scale intervention study clearly separates weight loss from dietary composition-related effects. Low-glycemic-index carbohydrates and, to a lesser extent, low-protein intake may specifically reduce low-grade inflammation and associated comorbidities in overweight/obese adults.']"

The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, as well as the increased neurotoxicity on the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with Long COVID. We recruited 86 participants with Long COVID and 39 normal controls, assessed the WHO-QoL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abridged Version, Geneva, Switzerland) and the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (comprising depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia-fatigue rating scales) and measured PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and neurotoxicity (NT, comprising serum interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-18 and caspase-1, advanced oxidation protein products and myeloperoxidase, calcium and insulin resistance) in Long COVID. We found that 70.3% of the variance in HR-QoL was explained by the regression on the physio-affective phenome, lowered calcium and increased NT, whilst 61.5% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by calcium, NT, increased PBT, lowered SpO2, female sex and vaccination with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The effects of PBT and SpO2 on lowered HR-QoL were mediated by increased NT and lowered calcium yielding increased severity of the physio-affective phenome which largely affects HR-QoL. In conclusion, lowered HR-Qol in Long COVID is largely predicted by the severity of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways during acute and Long COVID.', 'Critical COVID-19 disease is accompanied by depletion of plasma tryptophan (TRY) and increases in indoleamine-dioxygenase (IDO)-stimulated production of neuroactive tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), including kynurenine (KYN). The TRYCAT pathway has not been studied extensively in association with the physiosomatic and affective symptoms of Long COVID. In the present study, we measured serum TRY, TRYCATs, insulin resistance (using the Homeostatic Model Assessment Index 2-insulin resistance, HOMA2-IR), C-reactive protein (CRP), physiosomatic, depression, and anxiety symptoms in 90 Long COVID patients, 3-10 months after remission of acute infection. We were able to construct an endophenotypic class of severe Long COVID (22% of the patients) with very low TRY and oxygen saturation (SpO2, during acute infection), increased kynurenine, KYN/TRY ratio, CRP, and very high ratings on all symptom domains. One factor could be extracted from physiosomatic symptoms (including chronic fatigue-fibromyalgia), depression, and anxiety symptoms, indicating that all domains are manifestations of the common physio-affective phenome. Three Long COVID biomarkers (CRP, KYN/TRY, and IR) explained around 40% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome. The latter and the KYN/TRY ratio were significantly predicted by peak body temperature (PBT) and lowered SpO2 during acute infection. One validated latent vector could be extracted from the three symptom domains and a composite based on CRP, KYN/TRY, and IR (Long COVID), and PBT and SpO2 (acute COVID-19). In conclusion, the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID is a manifestation of inflammatory responses during acute and Long COVID, and lowered plasma tryptophan and increased kynurenine may contribute to these effects.', 'Long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID) is associated with physio-somatic (chronic fatigue syndrome and somatic symptoms) and affective (depression and anxiety) symptoms. The severity of the long COVID physio-affective phenome is largely predicted by increased peak body temperature (BT) and lowered oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the acute infectious phase. This study aims to delineate whether the association of BT and SpO2 during the acute phase and the long COVID physio-affective phenome is mediated by neurotoxicity (NT) resulting from activated immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways.  We recruited 86 patients with long COVID (3-4 months after the acute phase) and 39 healthy controls and assessed serum C-reactive protein (CRP), caspase 1, interleukin (IL) 1 beta, IL-18, IL-10, myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and calcium (Ca), as well as peak BT and SpO2 during the acute phase.  Cluster analysis revealed that a significant part (34.9%) of long COVID patients (n = 30) show a highly elevated NT index as computed based on IL-1 beta, IL-18, caspase 1, CRP, MPO, and AOPPs. Partial least squares analysis showed that 61.6% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of long COVID could be explained by the NT index, lowered Ca, and peak BT/SpO2 in the acute phase and prior vaccinations with AstraZeneca or Pfizer. The most important predictors of the physio-affective phenome are Ca, CRP, IL-1 beta, AOPPs, and MPO.  The infection-immune-inflammatory core of acute COVID-19 strongly predicts the development of physio-affective symptoms 3-4 months later, and these effects are partly mediated by neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways.']"

A 2-phase cross-sectional study was designed in order to determine the prevalence of dementia, its subtypes, and mild cognitive impairment in a Bulgarian population.  The study sample consisted of 605 participants over the age of 65, residents of the city of Varna. A total of 540 participants (89%) completed the screening phase of the study. All positive screens and a control group were included in the diagnostic phase of the study, where comprehensive neuropsychological, clinical, and imaging assessments were performed.

Discussion: Our results support the hypothesis that prevalence of vascular cognitive impairment may be higher in Bulgaria than in most European countries."", 'Poststroke cognitive impairment is common, but the trajectory and magnitude of cognitive decline after stroke is unclear. We examined the course and determinants of cognitive change after stroke using individual participant data from the Stroke and Cognition Consortium.  Nine longitudinal hospital-based cohorts from 7 countries were included. Neuropsychological test scores and normative data were used to calculate standardized scores for global cognition and 5 cognitive domains. One-step individual participant data meta-analysis was used to examine the rate of change in cognitive function and risk factors for cognitive decline after stroke. Stroke-free controls were included to examine rate differences. Based on the literature and our own data that showed short-term improvement in cognitive function after stroke, key analyses were restricted to the period beginning 1-year poststroke to focus on its long-term effects.  A total of 1488 patients (mean age, 66.3 years; SD, 11.1; 98% ischemic stroke) were followed for a median of 2.68 years (25th-75th percentile: 1.21-4.14 years). After an initial period of improvement through up to 1-year poststroke, decline was seen in global cognition and all domains except executive function after adjusting for age, sex, education, vascular risk factors, and stroke characteristics (-0.053 SD/year [95% CI, -0.073 to -0.033]; P<0.001 for global cognition). Recurrent stroke and older age were associated with faster decline. Decline was significantly faster in patients with stroke compared with controls (difference=-0.078 SD/year [95% CI, -0.11 to -0.045]; P<0.001 for global cognition in a subgroup analysis).  Patients with stroke experience cognitive decline that is faster than that of stroke-free controls from 1 to 3 years after onset. An increased rate of decline is associated with older age and recurrent stroke.', 'There are few longitudinal studies with controversial results examining delayed changes in cognition after ischemic stroke and predictive values of neuropsychological and neuroimaging markers.  The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delayed changes in cognition in poststroke patients and their relationship to the neuropsychological and neuroimaging markers measured during the acute poststroke phase.  Eighty-five first-ever stroke inpatients (mean age 65.6 +/- 5.6 years) without previous cognitive complaints were prospectively evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at the 5th day and the 1st, 6th, and 12th months. A wide range of clinical, radiological, and neuropsychological variables were examined.  Our results showed significantly poorer performance on mini-mental state examination, memory, attention/executive functions, and processing speed in patients with stroke in comparison with stroke-free cognitively intact controls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that hippocampal atrophy is the strongest predictor of delayed cognitive impairment. Secondary divided subgroups according to Isaacs Set Test (IST) score showed that patients with IST score <= 28 had different patterns of cognitive and neurological impairment after 1 year. Baseline impairments in attention/executive functions and memory were associated with development of dementia in poststroke patients.  Executive functioning deficit appears to have a predictive power for cognitive impairment progression. The study suggests that IST as a screening test has a potential to be a reliable and quick tool for poststroke cognitive impairment evaluation and delayed cognitive and neurological outcome. Hippocampal atrophy was the strongest predictor for cognitive impairment outcome, even in poststroke cognitive impairment. The findings may set the stage for better poststroke management.']"

Given that individuals who believe that life is like a zero-sum game are likely to perceive their daily interactions with others as unfair, we expected that individuals with high BZSG experience more negative affect and fewer positive one, resulting in a lower satisfaction with life. In addition, we examined whether country-level BZSG may play a moderating role in these associations. Data were collected from student samples (N = 7146) in 35 countries. Multilevel modelling revealed that perceived social antagonism in social relations is negatively associated with satisfaction with life and that this relationship is mediated by both positive and negative affect at the individual level. The relation of individual BZSG and negative affect on satisfaction with life were weaker in societies with higher country-level BZSG, suggesting that the effects of BZSG may be less detrimental in these countries. These findings extend previous knowledge about predictors of life satisfaction and suggest that social beliefs might also be an important factor that influences subjective well-being. The contribution of the study is that the separate treatment of life satisfaction and positive and negative affect may be helpful in many research situations, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective.', 'The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) is a commonly used life satisfaction scale. Cross-cultural researchers use SWLS to compare mean scores of life satisfaction across countries. Despite the wide use of SWLS in cross-cultural studies, measurement invariance of SWLS has rarely been investigated, and previous studies showed inconsistent findings. Therefore, we examined the measurement invariance of SWLS with samples collected from 26 countries. To test measurement invariance, we utilized three measurement invariance techniques: (a) multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA), (b) multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (ML-CFA), and (c) alignment optimization methods. The three methods demonstrated that configural and metric invariances of life satisfaction held across 26 countries, whereas scalar invariance did not. With partial invariance testing, we identified that the intercepts of Items 2, 4, and 5 were noninvariant. Based on two invariant intercepts, factor means of countries were compared. Chile showed the highest factor mean; Spain and Bulgaria showed the lowest. The findings enhance our understanding of life satisfaction across countries, and they provide researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on how to conduct measurement invariance testing across countries.', ""There is hardly any cross-cultural research on the measurement invariance of the Brief Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scales (BMSLSS). The current article evaluates the measurement invariance of the BMSLSS across cultural contexts. This cross-sectional study sampled 7,739 adolescents and emerging adults in 23 countries. A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit of configural and partial measurement weights invariance models, indicating similar patterns and strengths in factor loading for both adolescents and emerging adults across various countries. We found insufficient evidence for scalar invariance in both the adolescents' and the emerging adults' samples. A multi-level confirmatory factor analysis indicated configural invariance of the structure at country and individual level. Internal consistency, evaluated by alpha and omega coefficients per country, yielded acceptable results. The translated BMSLSS across different cultural contexts presents good psychometric characteristics similar to what has been reported in the original scale, though scalar invariance remains problematic. Our results indicate that the BMSLSS forms a brief measure of life satisfaction, which has accrued substantial evidence of construct validity, thus suitable for use in cross-cultural surveys with adolescents and emerging adults, although evaluation of degree of invariance must be carried out to ensure its suitability for mean comparisons.""]"

A new framework is suggested according to which two aspects of awareness are distinguished: awareness of task information, and awareness of task processing. The number reduction task (NRT) was employed because it has two levels of organization, an overt one based on explicit knowledge of task instructions, and a covert one based on hidden abstract regularities of task structure (implicit knowledge). Each level can be processed consciously (explicitly) or non-consciously (implicitly). Different performance parameters were defined to evaluate changes between two sessions for each of the four conditions of awareness arising from whether explicit or implicit task information was processed explicitly or implicitly. In two groups of subjects, the interval between the pre-sleep and post-sleep sessions was filled either with early-night sleep, rich in slow wave sleep (SWS), or late-night sleep, rich in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. show that implicit processing of explicit information was improved in the post-sleep relative to the pre-sleep session only in the early-night group. Independently of sleep stage, changes between sessions occurred for explicit processing of implicit information only in those subjects who gained insight into the task regularity after sleep. It is concluded that SWS but not REM sleep specifically supports gains in computational skills for the processing of information that was accessible by consciousness before sleep.', 'Both cognitive and primary motor networks alter with advancing age in humans.

It is crucial to find a non-invasive method for early recurrence detection which allows early and radical treatment. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic and clinical value of [18F]FDG PET/CT in the follow-up regimen of patients after radically treated first regional recurrence and for early detection of operable disease progression.Material and methods: We performed [18F]FDG PET/CT in 96 consecutive patients who had a histologically proven regional recurrent disease that was radically treated. In 46 patients [18F]FDG PET/CT was used in the follow-up regimen and in the other 50 it was used for clarification of suspicious lesions seen in conventional studies. We explored the diagnostic performance of [18F]FDG PET/CT. We also compared the results with conventional studies and explored the clinical impact of [18F]FDG PET/CT by its ability to find localized disease progression in those groups. [18F]FDG PET/CT had better sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, and accuracy in patients with symptoms. Good results in the second group had a high price for the patients, as there was a prevalence of distant metastatic disease in the second group - 64.0% vs. 28.3% in the surveillance group (p = 0.001). [18F]FDG PET/CT revealed more of the distant and in-transit lesions and assisted in lymph node detection by guiding the ultrasonography. Owing to the [18F]FDG PET/CT surveillance, 64.5% of all operable lesions were found in the surveillance group vs. only 35.5% in the second group, where the distant metastatic disease was prevalent. [18F]FDG PET/CT used as a follow-up tool in the surveillance regimen of patients after the first recurrence showed excellent performance in timely and accurate recognition of operable lesions.

The aim of our study was to assess the value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting different types of malignant lesions - local recurrences, regional lymph nodes (RLN), in-transit (ITM) and distant metastases (DM) after radical excision of the primary lesion or regional recurrence.Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients with CM referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT for staging or after resection of locoregional recurrent disease. All patients had a combination of pre-PET/CT conventional imaging studies (CIS), including a whole body computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) of the RLN basin/s. The results from 18F-FDG PET/CT were compared with the CIS results. 246 consecutive patients, aged 10-87 years were included with identification of 71 malignant lymph nodes, 4 local recurrences, 28 ITM, and 65 DM in total. The detection rate of 18F-FDG PET/CT for RLN was 84.5%, and in the diagnosis of ITM and DM, it reached a sensitivity of 100.0% with 0.7% of false positive results. 18F-FDG PET/CT has an invaluable role in the detection of small, clinically silent ITM and DM and has a smaller value in RLN detection. It may guide the process of selection of suspicious lesions, suitable for biopsy or further ultrasound follow-up.']"

Pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator, reduces triglyceride levels and improves other lipid levels. In a multinational, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level, 200 to 499 mg per deciliter), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels of 40 mg per deciliter or lower to receive pemafibrate (0.2-mg tablets twice daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients were receiving guideline-directed lipid-lowering therapy or could not receive statin therapy without adverse effects and had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 100 mg per deciliter or lower. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, or death from cardiovascular causes. Among 10,497 patients (66.9% with previous cardiovascular disease), the median baseline fasting triglyceride level was 271 mg per deciliter, HDL cholesterol level 33 mg per deciliter, and LDL cholesterol level 78 mg per deciliter.

The overall incidence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups, but pemafibrate was associated with a higher incidence of adverse renal events and venous thromboembolism and a lower incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, the incidence of cardiovascular events was not lower among those who received pemafibrate than among those who received placebo, although pemafibrate lowered triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, and apolipoprotein C-III levels.', 'Lipoprotein(a) concentration is associated with cardiovascular events. Alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, lowers lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). A pre-specified analysis of the placebo-controlled ODYSSEY Outcomes trial in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) determined whether alirocumab-induced changes in lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C independently predicted major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). One to 12 months after ACS, 18,924 patients on high-intensity statin therapy were randomized to alirocumab or placebo and followed for 2.8 years (median). Lipoprotein(a) was measured at randomization and 4 and 12 months thereafter. The primary MACE outcome was coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. Baseline lipoprotein(a) levels (median: 21.2 mg/dl; interquartile range [IQR]: 6.7 to 59.6 mg/dl) and LDL-C [corrected for cholesterol content in lipoprotein(a)] predicted MACE. Alirocumab reduced lipoprotein(a) by 5.0 mg/dl (IQR: 0 to 13.5 mg/dl), corrected LDL-C by 51.1 mg/dl (IQR: 33.7 to 67.2 mg/dl), and reduced the risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78 to 0.93). Alirocumab-induced reductions of lipoprotein(a) and corrected LDL-C independently predicted lower risk of MACE, after adjustment for baseline concentrations of both lipoproteins and demographic and clinical characteristics. A 1-mg/dl reduction in lipoprotein(a) with alirocumab was associated with a HR of 0.994 (95% CI: 0.990 to 0.999; p = 0.0081). Baseline lipoprotein(a) and corrected LDL-C levels and their reductions by alirocumab predicted the risk of MACE after recent ACS. Lipoprotein(a) lowering by alirocumab is an independent contributor to MACE reduction, which suggests that lipoprotein(a) should be an independent treatment target after ACS.

We sought to determine whether alirocumab, a human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), would improve cardiovascular outcomes after an acute coronary syndrome in patients receiving high-intensity statin therapy. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 18,924 patients who had an acute coronary syndrome 1 to 12 months earlier, had a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of at least 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter), a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter), or an apolipoprotein B level of at least 80 mg per deciliter, and were receiving statin therapy at a high-intensity dose or at the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alirocumab subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg (9462 patients) or matching placebo (9462 patients) every 2 weeks. The dose of alirocumab was adjusted under blinded conditions to target an LDL cholesterol level of 25 to 50 mg per deciliter (0.6 to 1.3 mmol per liter). The primary end point was a composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. The median duration of follow-up was 2.8 years. A composite primary end-point event occurred in 903 patients (9.5%) in the alirocumab group and in 1052 patients (11.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.93; P<0.001). A total of 334 patients (3.5%) in the alirocumab group and 392 patients (4.1%) in the placebo group died (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98). The absolute benefit of alirocumab with respect to the composite primary end point was greater among patients who had a baseline LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg or more per deciliter than among patients who had a lower baseline level. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups, with the exception of local injection-site reactions (3.8% in the alirocumab group vs. 2.1% in the placebo group).

Recognizing the potential of new compounds to inhibit P-gp function and/or expression is essential in the search for effective anticancer drugs. Eleven Hsp90 inhibitors containing an isoxazolonaphtoquinone core were synthesized and evaluated in two MDR models comprised of sensitive and corresponding resistant cancer cells with P-gp overexpression (human non-small cell lung carcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma). We investigated the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on cell growth inhibition, P-gp activity and P-gp expression. Structure-activity relationship analysis was performed in respect to cell growth and P-gp inhibition. Compounds 5, 7, and 9 directly interacted with P-gp and inhibited its ATPase activity. Their potential P-gp binding site was identified by molecular docking studies. In addition, these compounds downregulated P-gp expression in MDR colorectal carcinoma cells, showed good relative selectivity towards cancer cells, while compound 5 reversed resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel in concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, compounds 5, 7 and 9 could be promising candidates for treating cancers with P-gp overexpression.', ""Thienopyrimidines are structural analogs of quinazolines, and the creation of new 2-alkyl derivatives of ethyl 4-aminothienopyrimidine-6-carboxylates for the study of their anti-proliferative properties is of great pharmacological interest.

The obtained results indicate that the tested compounds are not cytotoxic or phototoxic, and that they are appropriate to be studied for their anti-proliferative and anti-tumor properties. The anti-proliferative potential of the compounds was investigated on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, as well as a MCF-10A cell line (normal human mammary epithelial cells). The most toxic to MCF-7 was thienopyrimidine 3 with IC50 13.42 mu g/mL (IC50 0.045 mu M), followed by compound 4 (IC50 28.89 mu g/mL or IC50 0.11 mu M). The thienopyrimidine 4 revealed higher selectivity to MCF-7 and lower activity (IC50 367 mu g/mL i.e., 1.4 mu M) than compound 3 with MCF-10A cells. With respect to MDA-MB-231 cells, ester 2 manifested the highest effect with IC50 52.56 mu g/mL (IC50 0.16 mu M), and 2-ethyl derivative 4 revealed IC50 62.86 mu g/mL (IC50 0.24 mu M). It was estimated that the effect of the substances on the cell cycle progression was due to cell cycle arrest in the G2 stage for MDA-MB-231, while arrest in G1 was detected for the estrogen (ER)-positive MCF-7 cell line. The tested compound's effects on the change of the zeta potential in the tumorigenic cells utilized in this study were determined.

As the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine core is a bioisostere of the 4-anilinoquinazoline, various new thienopyrimidine derivatives were synthesized by modifying the structure of the clinically used anticancer quinazoline EGFR inhibitors of the first generation - gefitinib, and second-generation - dacomitinib and canertinib. It was reported that some thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives showed improved EGFR inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the benzimidazole heterocycle is present as a pharmacophore unit in the structure of many clinically used chemotherapeutic agents. Some 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives, possessing anticancer activity, demonstrated EGFR inhibition and the benzimidazole derivative EGF816 is currently in the second phase of clinical trials.  The objectives of the study were the design of a novel series thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines, synthesis of the compounds and investigation of their effects towards human cancer HT-29, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, HepG2 and to normal human Lep3 cell lines. (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).  The synthetic protocol implemented cyclocondensation of 2-amino-thiophenes and nitriles in an inert medium, aza-Michael addition to benzimidazole derivatives and nucleophylic substitution at the N3 place. MTS test was used in order to establish the cytotoxicity of the tested compounds. SAR analysis and in silico assessment of the inhibitory potential towards human oncogenic B-V599E-Raf were performed using Molinspiration tool and Molecular Operating environment software.  The MTS test data showed that almost all studied thieno[2,3-d] pyirimidines (9-13, 21-22 and 25) manifest high inhibitory effect on cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations, whereas compounds 9 (IC50 = 130 nM) and 10 (IC50 = 261 nM) containing amino acid moiety, and 21 (IC50 = 108 nM) possessing two thienopyrimidine moieties attached to a 1,3-disubstituted benzimidazole linker, revealed many times lower toxicity against Lep3 cells compared to the cancer cells. Thienopyrimidines 11-13 possessed high selectivity against HeLa cells. Compound 13 showed high inhibitory activity against MDA-MB-231 and HepG2, with IC50 1.44 nM and 1.11 nM respectively. To outline the possible biological target of the studied coumpounds, their potential to interact with human oncogenic B-V599E-Raf was explored by a docking study. As a result, it was suggested that the benzimidazolyl and glycyl fragments could enhance the binding ability of the new compounds by increasing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and by stabilizing the inactive form of the enzyme.  The thienopyrimidines tested in vitro for human cancer HT-29, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, HepG2 and normal human Lep3 cell lines demonstrated cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range. It was established that compounds 9, 10 and 21 showed many times lower toxicity against normal Lep3 cells that can provide a high selectivity towards all four cancer cell lines at small concentrations. Based on the analysis of the structure-activity relationship, the observed trends in the cytotoxicity could be related to the lipophilicity and the topological polar surface area of the tested compounds.

To identify additional susceptibility loci for this common cancer, we conducted a meta-analysis of >10 million SNPs in 43,303 prostate cancer cases and 43,737 controls from studies in populations of European, African, Japanese and Latino ancestry. Twenty-three new susceptibility loci were identified at association P < 5 x 10(-8); 15 variants were identified among men of European ancestry, 7 were identified in multi-ancestry analyses and 1 was associated with early-onset prostate cancer. These 23 variants, in combination with known prostate cancer risk variants, explain 33% of the familial risk for this disease in European-ancestry populations. These findings provide new regions for investigation into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and demonstrate the usefulness of combining ancestrally diverse populations to discover risk loci for disease.', 'Prostate cancer risk stratification using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrates considerable promise in men of European, Asian, and African genetic ancestries, but there is still need for increased accuracy. We evaluated whether including additional SNPs in a prostate cancer polygenic hazard score (PHS) would improve associations with clinically significant prostate cancer in multi-ancestry datasets. In total, 299 SNPs previously associated with prostate cancer were evaluated for inclusion in a new PHS, using a LASSO-regularized Cox proportional hazards model in a training dataset of 72,181 men from the PRACTICAL Consortium. The PHS model was evaluated in four testing datasets: African ancestry, Asian ancestry, and two of European Ancestry-the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) and the ProtecT study. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated to compare men with high versus low PHS for association with clinically significant, with any, and with fatal prostate cancer. The impact of genetic risk stratification on the positive predictive value (PPV) of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer was also measured. The final model (PHS290) had 290 SNPs with non-zero coefficients. Comparing, for example, the highest and lowest quintiles of PHS290, the hazard ratios (HRs) for clinically significant prostate cancer were 13.73 [95% CI: 12.43-15.16] in ProtecT, 7.07 [6.58-7.60] in African ancestry, 10.31 [9.58-11.11] in Asian ancestry, and 11.18 [10.34-12.09] in COSM. Similar results were seen for association with any and fatal prostate cancer. Without PHS stratification, the PPV of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer in ProtecT was 0.12 (0.11-0.14). For the top 20% and top 5% of PHS290, the PPV of PSA testing was 0.19 (0.15-0.22) and 0.26 (0.19-0.33), respectively. We demonstrate better genetic risk stratification for clinically significant prostate cancer than prior versions of PHS in multi-ancestry datasets. This is promising for implementing precision-medicine approaches to prostate cancer screening decisions in diverse populations.', ""Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, and is a target for risk reduction strategies. The effects of alcohol consumption on prostate cancer incidence and survival remain unclear, potentially due to methodological limitations of observational studies. In this study, we investigated the associations of genetic variants in alcohol-metabolising genes with prostate cancer incidence and survival. We analysed data from 23,868 men with prostate cancer and 23,051 controls from 25 studies within the international PRACTICAL Consortium. Study-specific associations of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 alcohol-metabolising genes (Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADHs) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs)) with prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, by grade, were assessed using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively. The data across the 25 studies were meta-analysed using fixed-effect and random-effects models. We found little evidence that variants in alcohol metabolising genes were associated with prostate cancer diagnosis. Four variants in two genes exceeded the multiple testing threshold for associations with prostate cancer mortality in fixed-effect meta-analyses. SNPs within ALDH1A2 associated with prostate cancer mortality were rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed=0.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91; p values=0.002); rs12910509, HRfixed=0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values=0.003); and rs8041922 (HRfixed=0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values=0.002). These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other. In ALDH1B1, rs10973794 (HRfixed=1.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79; p values=0.002) was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with low-grade prostate cancer. These results suggest that alcohol consumption is unlikely to affect prostate cancer incidence, but it may influence disease progression. What's new? Alcohol may spur prostate cancer progression, though it does not appear to affect incidence, according to new analysis. Variation in genes involved in alcohol metabolism affect how much the body is exposed to carcinogenic metabolites. These authors examined 68 genetic variants in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes, seeking a link with prostate cancer risk. While they found no evidence that these variants alter prostate cancer incidence, they did show that SNPs in the ALDH1A2 gene affect prostate cancer mortality. From a public health standpoint, these results suggest reducing alcohol consumption could slow prostate cancer disease progression.""]"

Systolic blood pressure variability measurements were made on 744 participants at the start of the trial. Systolic blood pressure variability was calculated over three time frames: 24 h, daytime and night-time. The placebo and active treatment subgroups were analysed separately using an intention-to-treat principle, adjusting for confounding factors using a multiple Cox regression model. Participants An elderly hypertensive European population. Main outcome measures Stroke, cardiac events (fatal and non-fatal heart failure, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and sudden death) and cardiovascular mortality (death attributed to stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, sudden death, pulmonary embolus, peripheral vascular disease and aortic dissection). The risk of stroke increased by 80% (95% confidence interval: 17-176%) for every 5 mmHg increase in night-time systolic blood pressure variability in the placebo group. Risk of cardiovascular mortality and cardiac events was not significantly altered. Daytime variability readings did not predict outcome. Antihypertensive treatment did not affect systolic blood pressure variability over the median 4.4-year follow-up. In the placebo group, but not the active treatment group, increased night-time systolic blood pressure variability on admission to the Syst-Eur trial was an independent risk factor for stroke during the trial.

The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients treated for hypertension is directly related to the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Diuretics have proven useful for the prevention of cardiovascular complications in addition to a long history of safety and efficacy. The main aim for this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of the combination of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and chlorthalidone (CTLD) to the combination of ARB and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with hypertension.  A comprehensive literature search was conducted through electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, PsyInfo, Cochrane, eLIBRARY.ru,andin July 2020 to identify studies that investigate the effect of the combination of angiotensin receptor blocker with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) expressed as a weighted mean difference (WMD) were our primary outcomes. The random-effects method was chosen as the primary analysis and results were presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity analysis was performed and bias was assessed.  Our search returned 2745 titles. Of them, 51 full-text articles remained to be subjected to assessment. Comparisons of ARB/HCTZ versus ARB showed changes in BP of -6.89 (-8.09, -5.69) mmHg for systolic BP and - 3.67 (-4.15, -3.19) mmHg for diastolic BP. For the ARB/CTLD versus ARB/HCTZ comparison changes were - 6.30 (-7.30, -5.29) mmHg for systolic BP and - 3.57 (-4.17, 2.98) mmHg for diastolic BP.  Our analysis suggests a small but significant favor for CTLD in blood pressure control when compared to HCTZ. We believe it should be considered as a valuable alternative for HCTZ and an option for fixed dose combinations with an ARB although further research is required.']"

The cell-free supernatants were analysed by HPLC. It was established that the presence of o-, m- and p- cresol has not prevented complete phenol assimilation but had significant delaying effect on the phenol degradation dynamics. The mutual influence of phenol and p-cresol was investigated.

We have performed 26 high-resolution genome-wide methylation array analyses to determine the methylation status of 27,627 CpG islands and compared the data between patients and healthy controls. Methylation profiles of DNAs were analyzed in six pools: 220 schizophrenia patients; 220 age-matched healthy controls; 110 female schizophrenia patients; 110 age-matched healthy females; 110 male schizophrenia patients; 110 age-matched healthy males. We also investigated the methylation status of 20 individual patient DNA samples (eight females and 12 males.

We found new candidate genes that principally participate in apoptosis, synaptic transmission and nervous system development (GABRA2, LIN7B, CASP3). Methylation profiles differed between the genders. In females, the most important genes participate in apoptosis and synaptic transmission (XIAP, GABRD, OXT, KRT7), whereas in the males, the implicated genes in the molecular pathology of the disease were DHX37, MAP2K2, FNDC4 and GIPC1. Data from the individual methylation analyses confirmed, the gender-specific pools results.

To examine shared genetic etiology, we use genome-wide genotype data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17-29% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 +/- 0.04 s.e.), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43 +/- 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47 +/- 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive disorder (0.32 +/- 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and ASD (0.16 +/- 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the negative control of Crohn's disease.

Eleven Q/A redox-pairs were tested on cultured cells and cancer-bearing mice. The following parameters were analyzed: cell proliferation/viability, mitochondrial superoxide, steady-state ATP, tissue redox-state, tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) expression, tumor growth, and survival. Q/A redox-pairs containing unprenylated quinones exhibited strong dose-dependent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, accompanied by overproduction of mitochondrial superoxide and accelerated ATP depletion. In normal cells, the same redox-pairs did not significantly affect the viability and energy homeostasis, but induced mild mitochondrial oxidative stress, which is well tolerated. Benzoquinone/ascorbate redox-pairs were more effective than naphthoquinone/ascorbate, with coenzyme Q0/ascorbate exhibiting the most pronounced anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Targeted anticancer effects of Q/A redox-pairs and their tolerance to normal cells and tissues are attributed to: (i) downregulation of quinone prenylation in cancer, leading to increased mitochondrial production of semiquinone and, consequently, superoxide; (ii) specific and accelerated redox-cycling of unprenylated quinones and ascorbate mainly in the impaired cancerous mitochondria due to their redox imbalance; and (iii) downregulation of tNOX.', 'Simple Summary: Glioblastoma is characterized by a pronounced redox imbalance due to elevated glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. New therapeutic strategies have been developed to modulate glioblastoma redox signaling to effectively suppress growth and prolong survival. However, drug selectivity and therapeutic relapse prove to be the major challenges. We describe a pharmacological strategy for the selective targeting and treatment of glioblastoma using the redox active combination drug menadione/ascorbate, which is characterized by tolerance to normal cells and tissues. Menadione/ascorbate treatment of glioblastoma mice suppressed tumor growth and significantly increased survival without adverse side effects. This is accompanied by increased oxidative stress, decreased reducing capacity and decreased cellular density in the tumor alone, as well as increased brain perfusion and decreased regulation of several oncoproteins and oncometabolites, which implies modulation of the immune response and reduced drug resistance. We believe that this therapeutic strategy is feasible and promising and deserves the attention of clinicians.Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive brain tumors, characterized by a pronounced redox imbalance, expressed in a high oxidative capacity of cancer cells due to their elevated glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The assessment and modulation of the redox state of glioblastoma are crucial factors that can provide highly specific targeting and treatment. Our study describes a pharmacological strategy for targeting glioblastoma using a redox-active combination drug. The experiments were conducted in vivo on glioblastoma mice (intracranial model) and in vitro on cell lines (cancer and normal) treated with the redox cycling pair menadione/ascorbate (M/A). The following parameters were analyzed in vivo using MRI or ex vivo on tissue and blood specimens: tumor growth, survival, cerebral perfusion, cellular density, tissue redox state, expression of tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Dose-dependent effects of M/A on cell viability, mitochondrial functionality, and redox homeostasis were evaluated in vitro. M/A treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly increased survival without adverse side effects. This was accompanied by increased oxidative stress, decreased reducing capacity, and decreased cellular density in the tumor only, as well as increased cerebral perfusion and down-regulation of tNOX and TGF-beta 1. M/A induced selective cytotoxicity and overproduction of mitochondrial superoxide in isolated glioblastoma cells, but not in normal microglial cells. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the over-reduced state of cancer cells and impairment of their pro-oncogenic  functionality, assessed by dose-dependent decreases in: NADH, NAD(+), succinate, glutathione, cellular reducing capacity, mitochondrial potential, steady-state ATP, and tNOX expression. The safety of M/A on normal cells was compromised by treatment with cerivastatin, a non-specific prenyltransferase inhibitor. In conclusion, M/A differentiates glioblastoma cells and tissues from normal cells and tissues by redox targeting, causing severe oxidative stress only in the tumor. The mechanism is complex and most likely involves prenylation of menadione in normal cells, but not in cancer cells, modulation of the immune response, a decrease in drug resistance, and a potential role in sensitizing glioblastoma to conventional chemotherapy.', 'Redox-active substances and their combinations, such as of quinone/ascorbate and in particular menadione/ascorbate (M/A; also named Apatone (R)), attract attention with their unusual ability to kill cancer cells without affecting the viability of normal cells as well as with the synergistic anticancer effect of both molecules. So far, the primary mechanism of M/A-mediated anticancer effects has not been linked to the mitochondria. The aim of our study was to clarify whether this combination drug affects mitochondrial functionality specifically in cancer cells. Studies were conducted on cancer cells (Jurkat, Colon26, and MCF7) and normal cells (normal lymphocytes, FHC, and MCF10A), treated with different concentrations of menadione, ascorbate, and/or their combination (2/200, 3/300, 5/500, 10/1000, and 20/2000 mu M/mu M of M/A). M/A exhibited highly specific and synergistic suppression on cancer cell growth but without adversely affecting the viability of normal cells at pharmacologically attainable concentrations. In M/A-treated cancer cells, the cytostatic/cytotoxic effect is accompanied by (i) extremely high production of mitochondrial superoxide (up to 15-fold over the control level), (ii) a significant decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, (iii) a decrease of the steady-state levels of ATP, succinate, NADH, and NAD(+), and (iv) a decreased expression of programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-one of the major immune checkpoints. These effects were dose dependent. The inhibition of NQO1 by dicoumarol increased mitochondrial superoxide and sensitized cancer cells to M/A. In normal cells, M/A induced relatively low and dose-independent increase of mitochondrial superoxide and mild oxidative stress, which seems to be well tolerated. These data suggest that all anticancer effects of M/A result from a specific mechanism, tightly connected to the mitochondria of cancer cells. At low/tolerable doses of M/A (1/100-3/300 mu M/mu M) attainable in cancer by oral and parenteral administration, M/A sensitized cancer cells to conventional anticancer drugs, exhibiting synergistic or additive cytotoxicity accompanied by impressive induction of apoptosis. Combinations of M/A with 13 anticancer drugs were investigated (ABT-737, barasertib, bleomycin, BEZ-235, bortezomib, cisplatin, everolimus, lomustine, lonafarnib, MG-132, MLN-2238, palbociclib, and PI-103). Low/tolerable doses of M/A did not induce irreversible cytotoxicity in cancer cells but did cause irreversible metabolic changes, including: (i) a decrease of succinate and NADH, (ii) depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, and (iii) overproduction of superoxide in the mitochondria of cancer cells only. In addition, M/A suppressed tumor growth in vivo after oral administration in mice with melanoma and the drug downregulated PD-L1 in melanoma cells. Experimental data suggest a great potential for beneficial anticancer effects of M/A through increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional anticancer therapy, as well as to the immune system, while sparing normal cells. We hypothesize that M/A-mediated anticancer effects are triggered by redox cycling of both substances, specifically within dysfunctional mitochondria. M/A may also have a beneficial effect on the immune system, making cancer cells visible and more vulnerable to the native immune response.']"

The present study aims to determine the capabilities of non-pathogenic and cellulolytic Bacillus licheniformis 24 as a 2,3-BD producer. By applying the Plackett-Burman design and response surface methodology through central composite design (CCD), a complex optimization of medium and process parameters was conducted. Thus, among ten studied factors of medium content, four components were evaluated with a significant positive effect on 2,3-BD formation. Their optimal values for 2,3-BD production (yeast extract, 13.38 g/L; tryptone, 6.41 g/L; K2HPO4, 4.2 g/L; MgSO4, 0.32 g/L), as well as the optimal temperature (37.8 degrees C), pH (6.23) and aeration rate (3.68 vvm) were predicted by CCD experiments and validated in a series of batch processes. In optimized batch fermentation of 200 g/L of glucose 91.23 g/L of 2,3-BD was obtained, with the overall productivity of 1.94 g/L/h and yield of 0.488 g/g. To reveal the maximum 2,3-BD tolerance of B. licheniformis 24, fed-batch fermentation was carried out. The obtained 138.8 g/L of 2,3-BD with a yield of 0.479 g/g and productivity of 1.16 g/L/h ranks the strain among the best 2,3-BD producers.', '2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD) is an alcohol highly demanded in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Its microbial production, safe non-pathogenic producer strains, and suitable substrates have been avidly sought in recent years. The present study investigated 2,3-BD synthesis by the GRAS Bacillus licheniformis 24 using chicory inulin as a cheap and renewable substrate. The process appears to be pH-dependent. At pH 5.25, the synthesis of 2,3-BD was barely detectable due to the lack of inulin hydrolysis. At pH 6.25, 2,3-BD concentration reached 67.5 g/L with rapid hydrolysis of the substrate but was accompanied by exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis. Since inulin conversion by bacteria is a complex process and begins with its hydrolysis, the question of the acting enzymes arose. Genome mining revealed that several glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzymes from different CAZy families are involved. Five genes encoding such enzymes in B. licheniformis 24 were amplified and sequenced: sacA, sacB, sacC, levB, and fruA. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed that the process of inulin hydrolysis is regulated at the level of gene expression, as four genes were significantly overexpressed at pH 6.25. In contrast, the expression of levB remained at the same level at the different pH values at all-time points. It was concluded that the sacC and sacA/fruA genes are crucial for inulin hydrolysis. They encode exoinulinase (EC 3.2.1.80) and sucrases (EC 3.2.1.26), respectively. The striking overexpression of sacB under these conditions led to increased synthesis of EPS; therefore, the simultaneous production of 2,3-BD and EPS cannot be avoided.', ""Bacillus licheniformis 24 (BL24) is an efficient, non-pathogenic producer of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD). However, during inulin fermentation, the strain produces large amounts of exopolysaccharides (EPS), which interfere with the process' performance. The present study aims to investigate the effect that inactivation of the sacB gene, encoding levansucrase in BL24, has on 2,3-BD production efficiency. Knockout of the sacB gene was accomplished via insertional inactivation. The sacB-knockout variant formed 0.57 g/L EPS from sucrose and 0.7-0.8 g/L EPS from glucose and fructose, a 15- and 2.5-fold reduction relative to the wild type, respectively. Likewise, during batch fermentation with soluble inulin Frutafit (R) CLR, the mutant BL Delta sacB produced significantly less EPS than the wild type, allowing the maintenance of pH at values favoring 2,3-BD synthesis. At pH 6.50, BL Delta sacB reached a record titer of 128.7 g/L 2,3-BD, with productivity of 1.65 g/L/h, and a yield of 85.8% of the theoretical maximum. The obtained concentration of 2,3-BD is two-fold higher compared to that of the wild type. Subsequent RT-qPCR assays confirmed a successful sacB knockout. Three of the genes involved in inulin hydrolysis (sacA, sacC, and fruA) maintained their expression levels compared to the wild type, while that of levB increased. Although total EPS accumulation could not be completely eliminated via sacB gene knockout alone, the overall reduction in EPS content has enabled the highest yield of 2,3-BD from inulin to date, a promising result for the industrial production from inulin-rich substrates.""]"

Use of technologies can thereby improve quality of life and reduce the burden of diabetes management compared with self-injection of multiple daily insulin doses (MDI). Novel hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems represent the latest treatment modality for T1D, combining modern glucose sensors and insulin pumps with a linked control algorithm to offer automated insulin delivery in response to blood glucose levels and trends. HCL systems have been associated with increased TIR, improved HbA1c, and fewer hypoglycemic events compared with CSII, SAP, and MDI, thereby potentially improving quality of life for people with diabetes (PwD) while reducing the costs of treating short- and long-term diabetes-related complications. However, many barriers to their use and regional inequalities remain in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Published data suggest that access to diabetes technologies is hindered by lack of funding, underdeveloped health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and guidelines, unfamiliarity with novel therapies, and inadequacies in healthcare system capacities. To optimize the use of diabetes technologies in CEE, an international meeting comprising experts in the field of diabetes was held to map the current regional access, to present the current national reimbursement guidelines, and to recommend solutions to overcome uptake barriers. Recommendations included regional and national development of HTA bodies, efficient allocation of resources, and structured education programs for healthcare professionals and PwD. The responsibility of the healthcare community to ensure that all individuals with T1D gain access to modern technologies in a timely and economically responsible manner, thereby improving health outcomes, was emphasized, particularly for interventions that are cost-effective.', 'The goal of this study was to calculate and compare the direct medical cost of diabetes and its complications for insulin treated patients from the perspective of the health insurance fund. In a combined prospective and retrospective observational study with duration of 6 months, 433 patients were randomly selected and were divided into 3 subgroups: 153 patients on insulin analogues, 115 on human insulin, and 165 on a combination of insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD). The cost of therapy for each group of patients was calculated as a sum of the units of health care resources used and their individual price. The average cost attributable to each individual patient was calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of patients. A second step analysis was performed in a hospitalized subgroup of patients during the period. Insulin analogues, due to their higher prices, are with the highest cost per 6-month therapy (652.12 BGN), closely followed by the combination therapy east (479.54 BGN) in case just insulin therapy is considered In contrast, the cost of hospitalizations due to diabetes was found to be lowest in the group of patients on insulin analogues, followed by that for patients on a combination of insulin plus OAD therapy, and highest for the group on human insulin therapy. The main cost drivers are the medications for diabetes (46 % of the total cost on average), outpatient medications for diabetes complications (27%), and hospitalization clue to diabetes (14 %). These cost components account for 87% of the total cost. When adding the cost of hospitalizations due to diabetes complications, 96 % of the total cost is reached A selection of the main treatment pattern linked to insulin/ insulin analogue +/- OAD administration depends on individual patients characteristics (type of DM, Hb1Ac, age, complications etc.) as well as healthcare system organization (e.g. sequential therapy). It explains the cost structure differences between the heterogenic groups analysed Intensification of the insulin therapy seems to be cost neutral from the total costs perspective.

This was a 24-week prospective, observational study performed in 40 inpatient and outpatient sites across the country.  A total of 286 patients were included in the study. The mean age (+/- SD) was 61.2 +/- 10.0 years with duration of diabetes of 11.64 +/- 7.5 years and body mass index (BMI) of 32.1 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2). HbA1c before Gla-300 initiation was 9.8 +/- 1.0%, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 13.1 +/- 3.4 mmol/L. HbA1c and FPG change from baseline to week 24 was - 1.86% (p < 0.001) and - 4.8 mmol/L (p < 0.001), respectively. The proportion of patients reaching their individualized HbA1c at week 24 was 39.1% (95% CI 33.3-45.1%), while the proportion of patients reaching their individualized HbA1c target without confirmed and/or severe hypoglycaemia was 34.8% (95% CI 29.2-40.7%).

We estimated persistence with denosumab in older women at high fracture risk in clinical practice in Bulgaria. Eligible participants were post-menopausal women, > 70 years of age, diagnosed with osteoporosis (T-score <= - 2.5) and at high risk of fracture (>= 3% for hip and >= 20% for major osteoporotic fracture) who received at least one denosumab injection before enrollment. Planned follow-up was 24 months. The primary endpoint was persistence to denosumab at 12, 18, and 24 months (defined as receiving all denosumab injections within 6 months +/- 60 days of the previous injection). 250 women were enrolled across 12 Bulgarian endocrinology/rheumatology practices; median follow up, 736 days. Mean (SD) age was 75.8 (4.2) years; mean (SD) FRAX(R) was 13.1 (8.6) for hip and 26.1 (9.5) for major osteoporotic fracture; 47 (18.8%) women had prior osteoporosis therapy and 104 (41.6%) had prior fracture.

Due to its specific mode of action, denosumab is already successfully used as a new targeted therapy of women with low bone mineral density (BMD) resulting from postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The aim of this one-year clinical observational study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of denosumab in 36 women with PMO. Denosumab was, administered as a subcutaneous injection of 60 mg once per 6 months. The therapeutic efficacy of denosumab was assessed on the basis of BMD, trabecular bone score (TBS) and fracture risk based on FRAX (R) (WHO Fracture Risk Assessment tool). Treatment with denosumab resulted in an increase in BMD by 3.9% at the lumbar spine and by 1.3% at the total hip (as compared to the baseline BMD values) with corresponding improvement of the T-score of the lumbar spine of 13.8% and 4.5% of total hip, respectively TBS is a new texture measurement that correlates with the quality of bone microarchitecture. At month 12, the TBS appeared to be significantly increased by 1.7% as compared to its baseline mean value. The risk of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture assessed by FRAX (R) was reduced by 13.3% and 38.4%, respectively These data, representing the local clinical experience, suggest that denosumab might be used as an effective treatment of PMO.', 'Persistence with osteoporosis therapy is critical for fracture risk reduction. This observational study evaluated medication-taking behaviour of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis receiving denosumab or oral ibandronate in real-world clinical practice in Bulgaria. Compared with ibandronate, densoumab was associated with a lower discontinuation rate and greater increases in bone mineral density. Persistence with osteoporosis therapy is critical for fracture risk reduction and the effectiveness of such treatments may be reduced by low persistence. Alternative therapies such as denosumab may improve persistence. This study aimed to describe medication-taking behaviour in women with osteoporosis, prescribed denosumab or oral ibandronate, in Bulgarian clinical practice. This retrospective, observational, multicentre chart review (with up to 24 months follow-up) enrolled postmenopausal women initiating 6-monthly denosumab injection or monthly oral ibandronate treatment for osteoporosis between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2012. Overall, 441 women were enrolled (224 had initiated denosumab, 217 had initiated ibandronate). At baseline, more women in the denosumab group than in the ibandronate group had a previous fracture (25.5 vs 17.5%; p = 0.043) and past exposure to osteoporosis therapy (19.6 vs 12.0%; p = 0.028). At 24 months, 4.5% of women receiving denosumab had discontinued therapy compared with 56.2% of women receiving ibandronate. Median time to discontinuation was longer in the denosumab group (729 days; interquartile range (IQR), 728.3-729.0) than in the ibandronate group (367 days; IQR, 354.0484.8; p < 0.001). At 24 months, there were significantly greater changes in BMD T-scores at the lumbar spine (p < 0.001) and femoral neck (p < 0.001) in patients receiving denosumab than in those receiving ibandronate. At 24 months, persistence with denosumab was 98.7%. This real-world study demonstrates there is a low discontinuation rate and high persistence with denosumab. Denosumab was associated with greater BMD increases than ibandronate, which could reduce fracture risk.']"

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults (>= 18 years) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, North Macedonia, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Mental health (anxiety, depression, resilient coping, hope) and other study data were collected between June-August 2020. Of the 13,263 participants, 62.8% were female and 51.7% were 18-34 years old. Participants living in Brazil had the highest anxiety and depression symptoms while participants living in Singapore had the lowest. Greater personal COVID-19 exposure was associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms, but country-level COVID-19 factors were not. Higher levels of hope were associated with reduced anxiety and depression; higher levels of resilient coping were associated with reduced anxiety but not depression. Substantial variations exist in anxiety and depression symptoms across countries during the COVID-19 lockdown, with personal COVID-19 exposure being a significant risk factor. Strategies that mitigate COVID-19 exposure and enhance hope and resilience may reduce anxiety and depression during global emergencies.']"

Materials: Plasma levels of alpha B-crystallin were studied in 163 patients: 52 healthy non-COPD smokers; 20 COPD smokers in Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages I-II; 43 COPD smokers in GOLD stages III-IV. Forty-eight patients were diagnosed with acute inflammatory respiratory disease. The plasma levels of alpha B-crystallin antibodies were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Calbiochem), and were confirmed with Western blotting. Tissue expression of the protein was compared in three different groups of patients: COPD smokers, COPD nonsmokers, and in patients with age-related emphysema.  The mean level of anti-alpha B-crystallin antibodies in non-COPD smokers was 0.291 nm. In COPD smokers it was 0.352 nm and, in patients with inflammatory lung diseases, 0.433 nm. There was a statistically significant difference between COPD smokers and healthy non-COPD smokers (P = 0.010). The same could be observed comparing the group of patients with acute inflammation and non-COPD healthy smokers (P = 0.007).

Tissue detection of the protein showed that it was significantly overexpressed in COPD smokers in comparison to COPD nonsmokers and was only slightly expressed in patients with age-related emphysema.  alpha B-crystallin is increased in patients with inflammatory lung diseases. Though unspecific, it could be used in a panel of markers discerning COPD smokers from healthy nonsmokers.

The study included 158 patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) II, III, and IV stages) and 123 individuals unaffected by the disease (control). A higher frequency of obesity compared to the controls (20.3%) was observed in patients with COPD (29.1%, p = 0.093), especially in those with GOLD II stage (37.7%, p = 0.009). Prevalence of obesity was highest in COPD GOLD II, followed by GOLD III and IV stages (p = 0.068).

Interestingly, there was a statistically significant moderate positive correlation between the body mass index and forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of predicted value in the whole patients' group (R = 0.295, p = 0.0002) as well as in the subgroups of GOLD II (R = 0.257, p = 0.024) and GOLD III COPD (R = 0.259, p = 0.031).The results of our study propose that the increased body mass, particularly obesity is frequent comorbidity to COPD, especially to less severe diseases. Moreover, the results suggest that the higher body weight may provide some protection against the impairment of lung functions in patients with stable COPD."", ""The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy report provides guidance on effective management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to local healthcare systems. However, COPD is a heterogenous disease and certain aspects, including prevalence, disease-time course and phenotype distribution, can differ between countries. Moreover, features of clinical practice and healthcare systems for patients with COPD can vary widely, even in geographically close and economically similar countries. Areas covered Based on an initial workshop of respiratory physicians from eleven countries across Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in December 2018 and subsequent discussions, this article offers region-specific insights from clinical practice and healthcare systems in CEE. Taking recommendations from the GOLD 2022 report into account, we suggest approaches to adapt these into national clinical guidelines for COPD management in CEE. Expert opinion Several factors should be considered when optimizing management of COPD in CEE compared with other regions, including differences in smoking status, vaccination uptake, prevalence of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, and variations in healthcare systems. We provide guidance and algorithms for pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of COPD for the following scenarios: initial and follow-up treatment, treatment of patients with frequent exacerbations, and withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids where appropriate. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease of the lungs. It causes symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, and production of phlegm. In people with COPD, these symptoms often reduce the quality of their lives. From time to time, symptoms may get worse in people with the disease. This worsening is known as 'exacerbation'. Exacerbations of COPD can be so bad that they lead to hospital admissions. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) regularly gives advice to doctors around the world. This can help them to provide their patients with the best possible treatment for COPD. However, people with the disease and healthcare systems vary from country to country. This means that the guidance may need to be adjusted to the needs and available resources of different regions. This review looks at how COPD is treated in Central and Eastern Europe. We suggest how to adapt the GOLD recommendations to best suit the Central and Eastern European region.""]"

It is unclear whether the presence of these arrhythmias has therapeutic consequences. We sought to summarize evidence on the prevalence of atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) and their impact on risk of stroke. We performed a comprehensive, tabulated review of published literature on the prevalence of AHRE. In patients with AHRE, but without atrial fibrillation (AF), we reviewed the stroke risk and the potential risk/benefit of oral anticoagulation. Atrial high-rate episodes are found in 10-30% of AF-free patients. Presence of AHRE slightly increases stroke risk (0.8% to 1%/year) compared with patients without AHRE. Atrial high-rate episode of longer duration (e.g. those >24h) could be associated with a higher stroke risk. Oral anticoagulation has the potential to reduce stroke risk in patients with AHRE but is associated with a rate of major bleeding of 2%/year. Oral anticoagulation is not effective in patients with heart failure or survivors of a stroke without AF. It remains unclear whether anticoagulation is effective and safe in patients with AHRE. Atrial high-rate episodes are common and confer a slight increase in stroke risk. There is true equipoise on the best way to reduce stroke risk in patients with AHRE. Two ongoing trials (NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA) will provide much-needed information on the effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation using non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with AHRE.', 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease, associated with increased risk of mortality, stroke, heart failure, and worsens quality of life. There is a high incidence of AF recurrence despite the treatment. The aim of the study was to assess the time to recurrence of AF after sinus rhythm restoration with electrical or pharmacological cardioversion and to identify the risk factors.  This study included 101 patients with AF (56% females) at a mean age of 68.02 +/- 7 years, after sinus rhythm restoration in a clinical observation of 1-year placebo-controlled treatment with spironolactone (1:1). The patients were analyzed on the basis of AF recurrence, hospitalization, demographic parameters, comorbidities, embolic risk, and value of biomarker galectin-3 (Gal-3).  The average number of AF recurrences was 1.62 per patient per year. The median time of occurrence of at least one new episode was 48 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.24-81.76. Female patients experienced significantly more recurrences than male-53.3% vs. 28.6% hazard ration (HR)=1.76, 95% CI 1.02-3.03, p=0.036. The recurrences were more common with increased age, although not significantly. Patients with arterial hypertension had a threefold risk of recurrences than those without hypertension (p=0.025), independently of the treatment. CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score was significantly associated with AF recurrent episodes. Patients with gout had a twofold increased risk, without statistical significance (p=0.15). There was no difference in the AF episodes according to treatment with spironolactone. The levels of Gal-3 did not affect the number of AF recurrences (p=0.9).  AF is associated with frequent recurrences after restoration of sinus rhythm in the majority of the patients. Most of them occurred within the first 3 months. Female sex, arterial hypertension, and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score were significant predictors of AF recurrence. Spironolactone did not reduce AF recurrences.', 'BALKAN-AF evaluated patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF) management in real-world clinical practice in the Balkans. The objectives were: to assess the proportion of patients with first-diagnosed AF in the BALKAN-AF cohort and to compare the management of patients with newly-diagnosed AF and those with previously known AF in clinical practice.  Consecutive patients from 7 Balkan countries were enrolled prospectively to the snapshot BALKAN-AF survey.  Of 2712 enrolled patients, 2677 (98.7%) with complete data were included. 631 (23.6%) patients had newly-diagnosed AF and 2046 (76.4%) patients had known AF. Patients with newly-diagnosed AF were more likely to be hospitalized for AF and to receive single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) alone and less likely to receive OACs than those with known AF (all p < 0.001). The use of OAC was not significantly associated with the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (p = 0.624) or HAS-BLED score (p = 0.225) on univariate analysis. Treatment in capital city, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve disease, country of residence or rate control strategy were independent predictors of OAC use, whilst non-emergency centre, treatment by cardiologist, paroxysmal AF, palpitations, symptoms attributable to AF (as judged by physician), mean heart rate and AF as the main reason for hospitalization were independent predictors of rhythm control strategy use.  In BALKAN-AF survey, patients with newly-diagnosed AF were more often hospitalized, less often received OAC and were more likely to receive SAPT alone. The use of OAC for stroke prevention has not been driven by the individual patient stroke risk.']"

This study is about the diagnostic and predictive value of a panel of urinary oncometabolites (ethanolamine, kynurenine, (3-alanine, ??-alanine, leucine, isoleucine, ??-aminobutyric acid, and sarcosine) and correlation with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason score in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Materials and methods: The participants in this cross-sectional study were divided into PCa group (101 patients who matched the including criteria, average age 71) and control group (52 individuals, with no evidence of malignancy, without oncological and other chronic diseases, and without prostate gland pathology, average age 40). The criteria to be included in the PCa group were as follows: i) being diagnosed with prostate cancer, based on digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate ultrasound investigation, or biopsy; ii) not being subjected to a surgical or any other treatment; iii) not having any other concomitant oncological diseases, renal failure, diabetes mellitus. The urinary concentration of the selected metabolites was established through high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS).  The comparison of both groups established a significantly different elevated concentration of ethanolamine, sarcosine and kynurenine, and a significantly different decreased concentration of (3-alanine and isoleucine in PCa group. No changes of the values were detected in the PCa group with PSA levels below and above 10 ng/mL and Gleason score below and above 6 (p > 0.05). To test whether combination of several variables is more powerful in discriminating between PCa and control group multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. A model including ethanolamine, sarcosine, kynurenine, (3-alanine, and isoleucine demonstrated negative predictive power (NPP) 76.2% and positive predictive power (PPP) 81.8%.

Several small molecules of PSMA ligands of inhibitors binding to the active site of PSMA were developed. [Tc-99m]Tc-PSMA-T4 is a new radiopharmaceutical (Polatom) for imaging loco-regional metastases and/or local relapse in patients with prostate cancer. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the clinical application of SPECT-CT imaging with [Tc-99m]Tc-PSMA-T4 in patients with recurrent prostate cancer. Material and methods: Thirty-six patients with prostate cancer, aged 60-80 years with biochemical relapse of PSA (ranged from 0.1 to 73 ng/mL) were included. Three patients were studied after tru-cut biopsy, hormonal and cytoreductive radiotherapy and 33 patients out of 36 - after radical treatment (total prostatectomy or definitive radiotherapy of the tumour). All of them underwent whole-body imaging examinations with subsequent target SPECT-CT studies of the pelvis, abdomen and/or chest, 1-3 hrs post i.v. administration of [Tc-99m]Tc-PSMA-T4. The average activity dose was 6.3 MBq/kg in a man of 70 kg. A Dual-head SPECT-CT gamma camera with a low dose CT scan (Symbia T2, Siemens) was used. The images were interpreted based on all other clinical and radiological data. Follow-up could be conducted in 11/36 patients during that period.  Normal biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical with high activity background was observed in the liver, spleen, kidneys, lacrimal and salivary glands, bowels and urinary bladder. Positive imaging for local relapse in the prostate bad was imaged in 21 patients, lymph node metastases - in 16 cases, bone lesions - in 10 cases, pulmonary metastases - in 2 cases, hepatic lesions were visualised in one of them and in another - adrenal suprarenal metastasis with intensive tracer uptake significant for overexpression of PSMA. There was a suspicion for local recurrences in 4 patients with negative MRT studies who were followed up. In 3 cases, previously treated bone metastases were partially negative without tracer uptake, only some progressive bone lesions were positive. Five patients were with negative results. Sensitivity was 84.37% (27/32), specificity - 100% (4/4) and accuracy - 86.11% (31/36).  In conclusion SPECT-CT imaging with [Tc-99m]Tc-PSMA-T4 could be applied in patients with prostate cancer for the diagnosis of recurrent disease to determine personalized treatment for each patient. Specific uptake of this tracer, depicted by SPECT-CT images has clinical importance of identifying and assessing PSMA expression before consideration of Radio Ligand Therapy (RLT) with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA.

We compared the efficacy and safety of intravesical chemoablation with UGN-102 (a reverse thermal gel containing mitomycin), with or without subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor, to transurethral resection of bladder tumor alone in patients with low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. Materials and  This prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial recruited patients with new or recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer to receive initial treatment with either UGN-102 once weekly for 6 weeks or transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Patients were followed quarterly by endoscopy, cytology, and for-cause biopsy. The primary end point was disease-free survival. All patients were followed for adverse events.  Trial enrollment was halted by the sponsor to pursue an alternative development strategy after 282 of a planned 632 patients were randomized to UGN-102 +/- subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (n=142) or transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy (n=140), rendering the trial underpowered to perform hypothesis testing. Patients were predominantly male and >= 65 years of age. Tumor-free complete response 3 months after initial treatment was achieved by 92 patients (65%) who received UGN-102 and 89 patients (64%) treated by transurethral resection of bladder tumor. The estimated probability of disease-free survival 15 months after randomization was 72% for UGN-102 +/- transurethral resection of bladder tumor and 50% for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (hazard ratio 0.45). The most common adverse events (incidence >= 10%) in the UGN-102 group were dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and pollakiuria.  Primary, nonsurgical chemoablation with UGN-102 for the management of low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer offers a potential therapeutic alternative to immediate transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy and warrants further investigation.']"

Multiple sclerosis is one of the most studied diseases in neuroepidemiology and is characterized by an uneven geographical distribution worldwide.To estimate the prevalence and incidence of multiple sclerosis in Bulgaria and their distribution by age and gender, using data from the latest population census in the country, provided by the National Statistical Institute.An epidemiological study, covering a 7-year period-from 2015 to 2021 was conducted in Bulgaria. Eight regions with their population were included in the study-Blagoevgrad, Montana, Pernik, Svoge, Smolyan, Troyan, Haskovo and Shumen. Data, provided by the National Statistical Institute, were used to calculate the values of prevalence and incidence of multiple sclerosis. All cases were diagnosed using the 2017 McDonald's diagnostic criteria. The results obtained from the study were also used to determine the clinical characteristics of the Bulgarian patient. For the purposes of the epidemiological study an individual questionnaire was developed.On the prevalence day-07.09.2021, there were 532 people with multiple sclerosis in the studied regions of the country, revealing a prevalence of 121.2/100000 and an incidence of 4.2/100000. 182 of them were males and 350 were females comprising a ratio of 2:1 in favor of the women. More than 50% of all cases had relapsing-remitting course of disease. Secondary-progressive MS had 30% of all patients and 10% suffered from primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Clinically isolated syndrome was present in less than 5% of patients. The mean age at disease onset was 32.2 +/- 10.3 years.The established values of prevalence and incidence position Bulgaria in the area with a high frequency of MS. There is an increase in prevalence and incidence compared to previous studies conducted in the country. The results obtained are similar to those reported by the neighboring countries of the Balkan Peninsula and are close to the average values in Europe according to the latest edition of Atlas of Multiple Sclerosis."", ""As the feeling of happiness in multiple sclerosis (MS) is not investigated in Bulgaria yet, we decided to reveal some essential features of this non-motor symptom in multiple sclerosis patients with and without comorbidity. Material/ We examined 80 MS patients, 56 females and 24 males, at a mean age of 49 years. Forty of them presented with multiple sclerosis alone, and 40 did with multiple sclerosis and accompanying diseases. Health-related quality of life was assessed by means of Short Form-36 questionnaire and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Questionnaire with 54 items.  We established a lower frequency of feeling of happiness reported in MS patients with comorbidity. There were statistically significant positive correlations between the health status self-assessment and MS influence upon the feeling of happiness (R=0.428; p<0.01) as well as between MS influence upon social activities and the feeling of happiness (R=0.539; p<0.01). There were statistically reliable negative correlations between depression and feeling of happiness (R=-0.591; p<0.01) as well as between health-related quality of life scores and feeling of happiness in MS patients (R=-0,565; p<0,01). There was a statistically significant difference concerning the feeling of happiness (p<0.001) between the patients with MS only and those with MS and comorbidity.  Multiple sclerosis alone and with comorbidity exerts an unfavourable influence on individual patient's feeling of happiness. The presence of this common non-motor symptom in MS patients needs more comprehensive research."", 'Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase suppresses magnetic resonance imaging brain lesions and disease activity in multiple sclerosis but has limiting tolerability. We assessed the safety and efficacy of vidofludimus calcium, a novel, selective dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  This double-blind, 24 weeks, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial (EMPhASIS) enrolled patients 18-55 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to once-daily vidofludimus calcium (30 mg or 45 mg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of combined unique active lesions to week 24 between vidofludimus calcium 45 mg and placebo (clinicalTrials.gov number NCT03846219; EudraCT 2018-001896-19).  After 24 weeks, the mean cumulative number of combined unique active lesions was 6.4 (95% CI: 2.8-13.9) with placebo compared to 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1-4.9) with vidofludimus calcium 45 mg (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI: 0.22-0.64; p = 0.0002); the rate ratio between vidofludimus calcium 30 mg and placebo was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.17-0.53; p < 0.0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 30 (44%) of patients assigned placebo and 60 (43%) of patients assigned vidofludimus calcium. Serious adverse events occurred in one (1%) assigned placebo and two (1%) assigned vidofludimus calcium. No increased incidence of infectious, hepatic, or renal treatment-emergent adverse events or serious adverse events was observed. Interpretation: Treatment with vidofludimus calcium led to a reduction in new magnetic resonance imaging lesions in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Assessment in longer, larger trials is justified.']"

The main flavour of our approach is a combination of fast search with a special account for overlooked physical interactions. On the one hand, we take care of self-consistency and proton equilibria mutual effects of docking partners. On the other hand, Quantum.Ligand.Dock is the the only docking server offering such a subtle supplement to protein docking algorithms as quantum entanglement contributions. The motivation for development and proposition of the method to the community hinges upon two arguments-the fundamental importance of quantum entanglement contribution in molecular interaction and the realistic possibility to implement it by the availability of supercomputing power. The implementation of sophisticated quantum methods is made possible by parallelization at several bottlenecks on a GPU supercomputer. The high-performance implementation will be of use for large-scale virtual screening projects, structural bioinformatics, systems biology and fundamental research in understanding protein-ligand recognition. The design of the interface is focused on feasibility and ease of use. Protein and ligand molecule structures are supposed to be submitted as atomic coordinate files in PDB format.

It is essential to design newer drugs with varied approaches. A receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key part of SARS-CoV-2 virus, located on its surface, that allows it to dock to ACE2 receptors present on human cells, which is followed by admission of virus into cells, and thus infection is triggered. Specific receptor-binding domains on the spike protein play a pivotal role in binding to the receptor. In this regard, the in silico method plays an important role, as it is more rapid and cost effective than the trial and error methods using experimental studies. A combination of virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular simulations and machine learning techniques are applied on a library of natural compounds to identify ligands that show significant binding affinity at the hydrophobic pocket of the RBD. A list of ligands with high binding affinity was obtained using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for protein-ligand complexes. Machine learning (ML) classification schemes have been applied to obtain features of ligands and important descriptors, which help in identification of better binding ligands. A plethora of descriptors were used for training the self-organizing map algorithm. The model brings out descriptors important for protein-ligand interactions.', 'Virtual or in silico ligand screening combined with other computational methods is one of the most promising methods to search for new lead compounds, thereby greatly assisting the drug discovery process. Despite considerable progresses made in virtual screening methodologies, available computer programs do not easily address problems such as: structural optimization of compounds in a screening library, receptor flexibility/induced-fit, and accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions. It has been shown that structural optimization of chemical compounds and that post-docking optimization in multi-step structure-based virtual screening approaches help to further improve the overall efficiency of the methods. To address some of these points, we developed the program AMMOS for refining both, the 3D structures of the small molecules present in chemical libraries and the predicted receptor-ligand complexes through allowing partial to full atom flexibility through molecular mechanics optimization.  The program AMMOS carries out an automatic procedure that allows for the structural refinement of compound collections and energy minimization of protein-ligand complexes using the open source program AMMP. The performance of our package was evaluated by comparing the structures of small chemical entities minimized by AMMOS with those minimized with the Tripos and MMFF94s force fields. Next, AMMOS was used for full flexible minimization of protein-ligands complexes obtained from a mutli-step virtual screening. Enrichment studies of the selected pre-docked complexes containing 60% of the initially added inhibitors were carried out with or without final AMMOS minimization on two protein targets having different binding pocket properties. AMMOS was able to improve the enrichment after the pre-docking stage with 40 to 60% of the initially added active compounds found in the top 3% to 5% of the entire compound collection.  The open source AMMOS program can be helpful in a broad range of in silico drug design studies such as optimization of small molecules or energy minimization of pre-docked protein-ligand complexes. Our enrichment study suggests that AMMOS, designed to minimize a large number of ligands pre-docked in a protein target, can successfully be applied in a final post-processing step and that it can take into account some receptor flexibility within the binding site area.']"

The effects of Ag doping and the annealing temperatures (300-600 degrees C) were studied with respect to their structural, morphological, vibrational, and optical properties. Field Emission Scanning Electron microscopy (FESEM) investigation exhibited the grained, compact structures of TiO2-based films. Ag incorporation resulted in a rougher film surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the formation of Ag nanoparticles and AgO phase, along with anatase and rutile TiO2, strongly depending on Ag concentration and technological conditions. AgO fraction diminished after high temperature annealing above 500 degrees C. The vibrational properties were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It was found that silver presence induced changes in IR bands of TiO2 films. UV-VIS spectroscopy revealed that the embedment of Ag NPs in titania matrix resulted in higher absorbance across the visible spectral range due to local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Ag doping reduced the optical band gap of sol-gel TiO2 films. The optical and plasmonic modifications of TiO2:Ag thin films by the number of layers and different technological conditions (thermal and UV treatment) are discussed.', 'Monometallic (Ni, Co, Cu) and bimetallic (Ni-Co, Ni-Cu) 10-20 wt.% metal containing catalysts supported on fly ash zeolite were prepared by post-synthesis impregnation method.

Finely dispersed metal oxides and mixed oxides were detected after the decomposition of the impregnating salt on the relevant zeolite support. Via reduction intermetallic, NiCo and NiCu phases were identified in the bimetallic catalysts. The catalysts were studied in hydrodeoxygenation of lignocellulosic biomass-derived levulinic acid to gamma-valerolactone (GVL) in a batch system by water as a solvent. Bimetallic, 10 wt.% Ni, and 10 wt.% Cu or Co containing fly ash zeolite catalysts showed higher catalytic activity than monometallic ones. Their selectivity to GVL reached 70-85% at about 100% conversion.

The XRPD results showed that crystalline Cu-0 and NixCuy intermetallic nanoparticles were formed in the reduced catalysts. The presence of the intermetallic phase affected the reducibility of the nickel by shifting it to a lower temperature, as confirmed by the H-2-TPR curves. Based on the M & ouml;ssbauer spectroscopic results, it was established that the iron contamination of the coal fly ash zeolites (CFAZs) was distributed in ionic positions of the zeolite lattice and as a finely dispersed iron oxide phase on the external surface of the supports. The formation of the NiFe alloy, not detectable by XRPD, was also evidenced on the impregnated samples.

The NiCu/SOD and NiCu/X catalysts showed total LA conversion and a high GVL yield (>75%) at a reaction temperature of 200 degrees C. It was found that the textural parameters of the catalysts have less influence on the catalytic activity, but rather the stable dispersion of metals during the reaction. The characterization of the spent catalyst found the rearrangement of the support structure. The high LA conversion and GVL yield can be attributed to the weak acidic character of the support and the moderate hydrogenation activity of the Ni-Cu sites with high dispersion.']"

Material and Method: One hundred and seventy nine cases of randomly selected invasive breast cancer patients, surgically treated between 2004 and 2007, were retrospectively studied. These were classified into steroid receptor positive (steroid receptor positive/HER2 negative), triple positive (steroid receptor and HER2 positive), triple negative (steroid receptor and HER2 negative) and HER2 overexpressing (steroid receptor negative /HER2 positive) carcinomas. Appropriate immunostaining and in-situ hybridization techniques were applied and results were statistically analyzed.  The median intra-tumor lymphatic vascular density and the median intra-tumor relative lymphatic vascular area were found to differ significantly among the studied groups of breast cancer (KW = 49.8611; p< 0.0001 and KW = 21.5122; p= 0.0001 respectively). There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of axillary node involvement among the studied groups of breast cancer (chi(2)= 1.66; Df= 3; p= 0.6460).  The present study indicates that HER2 overexpressing breast carcinomas have a consistent increase of intra-tumor lymphatic vessel counts as compared to all other subtypes. It is suggested that the newly formed vessels are probably not the only essential factor for lymphogenic spread of HER2 overexpressing breast carcinomas as they are not related to an increased incidence of lymph node metastases compared to the other studied subgroups.', 'Intravenous Trastuzumab is an effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer after failure of first-line chemotherapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2) - positive receptor.

She underwent left mastectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy for breast cancer. Histological examination showed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade III, estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative, HER2-positive receptor status. Radiotherapy and six courses with antracyclines were performed as adjuvant chemotherapy. One year after the operation she was diagnosed to have lung metastases. Treatment was initiated with Trastuzumab 8 mg/kg for loading dose and 4 mg/kg maintenance dose every week. Treatment was continued for more than two years. Control computer tomography indicates stable disease. No adverse events were reported for twenty four months of Trastuzumab treatment. Treatment was stopped due to patients withdrawn. Overall survival was 31 months. This case indicate that long term Trastuzumab would be an optimal treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer patients.', ""Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, affecting both low- and middle-income countries, with a growing number of cases. In 2024, about 310,720 women in the U.S. are projected to receive an invasive breast cancer diagnosis, alongside 56,500 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Breast cancer occurs in every country of the world in women at any age after puberty but with increasing rates in later life. About 65% of women with the BRCA1 and 45% with the BRCA2 gene variants develop breast cancer by age 70. While these genes account for 5% of breast cancers, their prevalence is higher in certain populations. Advances in early detection, personalised medicine, and AI-driven diagnostics are improving outcomes by enabling a more precise analysis, reducing recurrence, and minimising treatment side effects. Our paper aims to explore the vast applications of artificial intelligence within the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and how these advancements can contribute to elevating patient care as well as discussing the potential drawbacks of such integrations into modern medicine. We structured our paper as a non-systematic review and utilised Google Scholar and PubMed databases to review literature regarding the incorporation of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of non-palpable breast masses. AI is revolutionising breast cancer management by enhancing imaging, pathology, and personalised treatment. In imaging, AI can improve the detection of cancer in mammography, MRIs, and ultrasounds, rivalling expert radiologists in accuracy. In pathology, AI enhances biomarker detection, improving HER2 and Ki67 assessments. Personalised medicine benefits from AI's predictive power, aiding risk stratification and treatment response. AI also shows promise in triple-negative breast cancer management, offering better prognosis and subtype classification. However, challenges include data variability, ethical concerns, and real-world validation. Despite limitations, AI integration offers significant potential in improving breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcomes.""]"

The SWIFT (Studies with von Willebrand factor/Factor VIII) program is evaluating pdVWF/FVIII in patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD). The long-term efficacy and safety profile of pdVWF/FVIII was investigated in this multicenter, open-label, extension study.  Pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with VWD who required treatment of nonsurgical bleeds (NSBs), treatment during surgical events or who were receiving prophylaxis and who had completed one of two previous clinical trials of pdVWF/FVIII were included. Efficacy and safety analyses were performed for on-demand (n=10), prophylaxis (n=8), or on-demand and prophylaxis (n=2) treatment in patients pre-treated with pdVWF/FVIII for >= 12 months.  Seven patients experienced a total of 402 NSBs in the on-demand arm, of which 77 required treatment and nine NSB events in three patients were considered major. Nine patients reported 118 NSBs in the prophylaxis arm, with 96 events requiring treatment and seven patients experiencing 12 major NSB events. Excellent or good hemostatic efficacy was reported by the investigator for 98.7% (on-demand) and 97.9% (prophylaxis) of NSB events treated with pdVWF/FVIII, without relevant differences between subgroups by age. pdVWF/FVIII was well tolerated, and the adverse events seen were mild-moderate and consistent with the safety profile for this product seen in other studies. There were no cases of anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, development of VWF/FVIII inhibitors, thromboembolic events, or viral infections.  This contemporary comprehensive development program evaluating pdVWF/FVIII across all ages demonstrates long-term safety and efficacy for treatment and prevention of bleeds in patients with severe VWD, supporting the benefit-risk profile of pdVWF/FVIII.', 'Nuwiq (R) (human-cl rhFVIII) is a 4th generation recombinant human FVIII, without chemical modification or protein fusion, produced in a human cell-line. Aims/ This study (NuPreviq) was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, phase IIIb study of the efficacy and safety of personalized prophylaxis with Nuwiq (R) in 66 previously treated adults with severe haemophilia A. NuPreviq had three phases: (i) a 72-h pharmacokinetic (PK) phase; (ii) a 1-3 month standard prophylaxis phase; and (iii) a 6-month personalized prophylaxis phase. The personalized prophylaxis regimen was based on individual PK modelling for each patient according to whether their PK profile most closely fitted a two-or one-compartment model (NuPreviq approach). In cases of uncertainty, a noncompartment model was applied.  The median dosing interval during personalized prophylaxis was 3.5 days, with 57% of patients on <= 2 weekly dosing. Mean annualized bleeding rates during personalized prophylaxis were 1.45 (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 0 [0, 1.9]) for all bleeds, 0.79 (median [IQR]: 0 [0, 0]) for spontaneous bleeds, and 0.91 (median [IQR]: 0 [0, 0]) for joint bleeds. During personalized prophylaxis, 83.1% of patients were spontaneous bleed-free. Compared with standard prophylaxis, median weekly prophylaxis dose was reduced by 7.2% from 100.0 to 92.8 IU kg(-1) during the last 2 months of personalized prophylaxis. There were no FVIII inhibitors or treatment-related serious or severe adverse events.  PK-guided personalized prophylaxis with Nuwiq (R) provided bleeding protection and enabled the dosing interval to be extended to twice weekly or less in many patients and an overall dose reduction.', 'A global phase 3 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX-FP) in 63 previously treated male patients (12-61 years) with severe hemophilia B (factor IX [FIX] activity <= 2%). The study included 2 groups: group 1 patients received routine prophylaxis once every 7 days for 26 weeks, followed by either 7-, 10-, or 14-day prophylaxis regimen for a mean of 50, 38, or 51 weeks, respectively; group 2 patients received on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes for 26 weeks and then switched to a 7-day prophylaxis regimen for a mean of 45 weeks. The mean terminal half-life of rIX-FP was 102 hours, 4.3-fold longer than previous FIX treatment. Patients maintained a mean trough of 20 and 12 IU/dL FIX activity on prophylaxis with rIX-FP 40 IU/kg weekly and 75 IU/kg every 2 weeks, respectively. There was 100% reduction in median annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR) and 100% resolution of target joints when subjects switched from on-demand to prophylaxis treatment with rIX-FP (P<.0001). The median AsBR was 0.00 for all prophylaxis regimens. Overall, 98.6% of bleeding episodes were treated successfully, including 93.6% that were treated with a single injection. No patient developed an inhibitor, and no safety concerns were identified. These results indicate rIX-FP is safe and effective for preventing and treating bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia B at dosing regimens of 40 IU/kg weekly and 75 IU/kg every 2 weeks.']"

With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk outcome associations. We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. Findings In 2017,34.1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33.3-35.0) deaths and 121 billion (144-1.28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61.0% (59.6-62.4) of deaths and 48.3% (46.3-50.2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10.4 million (9.39-11.5) deaths and 218 million (198-237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7.10 million [6.83-7.37] deaths and 182 million [173-193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6.53 million [5.23-8.23] deaths and 171 million [144-201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4.72 million [2.99-6.70] deaths and 148 million [98.6-202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1.43 million [1.36-1.51] deaths and 139 million [131-147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4.9% (3.3-6.5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23.5% decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18.6% increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low. Interpretation By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.', 'Estimates of demographic metrics are crucial to assess levels and trends of population health outcomes. The profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations worldwide has underscored the need for timely estimates to understand this unprecedented event within the context of long-term population health trends. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 provides new demographic estimates for 204 countries and territories and 811 additional subnational locations from 1950 to 2021, with a particular emphasis on changes in mortality and life expectancy that occurred during the 2020-21 COVID-19 pandemic period. 22 223 data sources from vital registration, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources were used to estimate mortality, with a subset of these sources used exclusively to estimate excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2026 data sources were used for population estimation. Additional sources were used to estimate migration; the effects of the HIV epidemic; and demographic discontinuities due to conflicts, famines, natural disasters, and pandemics, which are used as inputs for estimating mortality and population. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate under-5 mortality rates, which synthesised 30 763 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 1365 surveys and censuses, and 80 other sources. ST-GPR was also used to estimate adult mortality (between ages 15 and 59 years) based on information from 31 642 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 355 surveys and censuses, and 24 other sources. Estimates of child and adult mortality rates were then used to generate life tables with a relational model life table system. For countries with large HIV epidemics, life tables were adjusted using independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated via an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, and other data sources. Excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 was determined by subtracting observed all-cause mortality (adjusted for late registration and mortality anomalies) from the mortality expected in the absence of the pandemic. Expected mortality was calculated based on historical trends using an ensemble of models. In location-years where all-cause mortality data were unavailable, we estimated excess mortality rates using a regression model with covariates pertaining to the pandemic. Population size was computed using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model. Life expectancy was calculated using age-specific mortality rates and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. Findings Global all-cause mortality followed two distinct patterns over the study period: age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1950 and 2019 (a 62 center dot 8% [95% UI 60 center dot 5-65 center dot 1] decline), and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-21; 5 center dot 1% [0 center dot 9-9 center dot 6] increase). In contrast with the overall reverse in mortality trends during the pandemic period, child mortality continued to decline, with 4 center dot 66 million (3 center dot 98-5 center dot 50) global deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2021 compared with 5 center dot 21 million (4 center dot 50-6 center dot 01) in 2019. An estimated 131 million (126-137) people died globally from all causes in 2020 and 2021 combined, of which 15 center dot 9 million (14 center dot 7-17 center dot 2) were due to the COVID-19 pandemic (measured by excess mortality, which includes deaths directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those indirectly due to other social, economic, or behavioural changes associated with the pandemic). Excess mortality rates exceeded 150 deaths per 100 000 population during at least one year of the pandemic in 80 countries and territories, whereas 20 nations had a negative excess mortality rate in 2020 or 2021, indicating that all-cause mortality in these countries was lower during the pandemic than expected based on historical trends. Between 1950 and 2021, global life expectancy at birth increased by 22 center dot 7 years (20 center dot 8-24 center dot 8), from 49 center dot 0 years (46 center dot 7-51 center dot 3) to 71 center dot 7 years (70 center dot 9-72 center dot 5). Global life expectancy at birth declined by 1 center dot 6 years (1 center dot 0-2 center dot 2) between 2019 and 2021, reversing historical trends. An increase in life expectancy was only observed in 32 (15 center dot 7%) of 204 countries and territories between 2019 and 2021. The global population reached 7 center dot 89 billion (7 center dot 67-8 center dot 13) people in 2021, by which time 56 of 204 countries and territories had peaked and subsequently populations have declined. The largest proportion of population growth between 2020 and 2021 was in sub-Saharan Africa (39 center dot 5% [28 center dot 4-52 center dot 7]) and south Asia (26 center dot 3% [9 center dot 0-44 center dot 7]). From 2000 to 2021, the ratio of the population aged 65 years and older to the population aged younger than 15 years increased in 188 (92 center dot 2%) of 204 nations. Interpretation Global adult mortality rates markedly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, reversing past decreasing trends, while child mortality rates continued to decline, albeit more slowly than in earlier years. Although COVID-19 had a substantial impact on many demographic indicators during the first 2 years of the pandemic, overall global health progress over the 72 years evaluated has been profound, with considerable improvements in mortality and life expectancy. Additionally, we observed a deceleration of global population growth since 2017, despite steady or increasing growth in lower-income countries, combined with a continued global shift of population age structures towards older ages. These demographic changes will likely present future challenges to health systems, economies, and societies. The comprehensive demographic estimates reported here will enable researchers, policy makers, health practitioners, and other key stakeholders to better understand and address the profound changes that have occurred in the global health landscape following the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and longer-term trends beyond the pandemic.', 'Detailed, comprehensive, and timely reporting on population health by underlying causes of disability and premature death is crucial to understanding and responding to complex patterns of disease and injury burden over time and across age groups, sexes, and locations. The availability of disease burden estimates can promote evidence-based interventions that enable public health researchers, policy makers, and other professionals to implement strategies that can mitigate diseases. It can also facilitate more rigorous monitoring of progress towards national and international health targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. For three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has filled that need. A global network of collaborators contributed to the production of GBD 2021 by providing, reviewing, and analysing all available data. GBD estimates are updated routinely with additional data and refined analytical methods. GBD 2021 presents, for the first time, estimates of health loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The GBD 2021 disease and injury burden analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 371 diseases and injuries using 100 983 data sources. Data were extracted from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, censuses, household surveys, disease-specific registries, health service contact data, and other sources. YLDs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific prevalence of sequelae by their respective disability weights, for each disease and injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific deaths by the standard life expectancy at the age that death occurred. DALYs were calculated by summing YLDs and YLLs. HALE estimates were produced using YLDs per capita and age-specific mortality rates by location, age, sex, year, and cause. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2 center dot 5th and 97 center dot 5th percentiles values of 500 draws. Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the estimation process. Counts and age-standardised rates were calculated globally, for seven super-regions, 21 regions, 204 countries and territories (including 21 countries with subnational locations), and 811 subnational locations, from 1990 to 2021. Here we report data for 2010 to 2021 to highlight trends in disease burden over the past decade and through the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Global DALYs increased from 2 center dot 63 billion (95% UI 2 center dot 44-2 center dot 85) in 2010 to 2 center dot 88 billion (2 center dot 64-3 center dot 15) in 2021 for all causes combined. Much of this increase in the number of DALYs was due to population growth and ageing, as indicated by a decrease in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates of 14 center dot 2% (95% UI 10 center dot 7-17 center dot 3) between 2010 and 2019. Notably, however, this decrease in rates reversed during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increases in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates since 2019 of 4 center dot 1% (1 center dot 8-6 center dot 3) in 2020 and 7 center dot 2% (4 center dot 7-10 center dot 0) in 2021. In 2021, COVID-19 was the leading cause of DALYs globally (212 center dot 0 million [198 center dot 0-234 center dot 5] DALYs), followed by ischaemic heart disease (188 center dot 3 million [176 center dot 7-198 center dot 3]), neonatal disorders (186 center dot 3 million [162 center dot 3-214 center dot 9]), and stroke (160 center dot 4 million [148 center dot 0-171 center dot 7]). However, notable health gains were seen among other leading communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases. Globally between 2010 and 2021, the age-standardised DALY rates for HIV/AIDS decreased by 47 center dot 8% (43 center dot 3-51 center dot 7) and for diarrhoeal diseases decreased by 47 center dot 0% (39 center dot 9-52 center dot 9). Noncommunicable diseases contributed 1 center dot 73 billion (95% UI 1 center dot 54-1 center dot 94) DALYs in 2021, with a decrease in age-standardised DALY rates since 2010 of 6 center dot 4% (95% UI 3 center dot 5-9 center dot 5). Between 2010 and 2021, among the 25 leading Level 3 causes, agestandardised DALY rates increased most substantially for anxiety disorders (16 center dot 7% [14 center dot 0-19 center dot 8]), depressive disorders (16 center dot 4% [11 center dot 9-21 center dot 3]), and diabetes (14 center dot 0% [10 center dot 0-17 center dot 4]). Age-standardised DALY rates due to injuries decreased globally by 24 center dot 0% (20 center dot 7-27 center dot 2) between 2010 and 2021, although improvements were not uniform across locations, ages, and sexes. Globally, HALE at birth improved slightly, from 61 center dot 3 years (58 center dot 6-63 center dot 6) in 2010 to 62 center dot 2 years (59 center dot 4-64 center dot 7) in 2021. However, despite this overall increase, HALE decreased by 2 center dot 2% (1 center dot 6-2 center dot 9) between 2019 and 2021. Interpretation Putting the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of causes of health loss is crucial to understanding its impact and ensuring that health funding and policy address needs at both local and global levels through cost-effective and evidence-based interventions. A global epidemiological transition remains underway. Our findings suggest that prioritising non-communicable disease prevention and treatment policies, as well as strengthening health systems, continues to be crucially important. The progress on reducing the burden of CMNN diseases must not stall; although global trends are improving, the burden of CMNN diseases remains unacceptably high. Evidence-based interventions will help save the lives of young children and mothers and improve the overall health and economic conditions of societies across the world. Governments and multilateral organisations should prioritise pandemic preparedness planning alongside efforts to reduce the burden of diseases and injuries that will strain resources in the coming decades.']"

We used a bibliometric approach to identify and analyze the scientific literature on VR and AR research in medicine, revealing the popular research topics, key authors, scientific institutions, countries, and journals. We further aimed to capture and describe the themes and medical conditions most commonly investigated by VR and AR research.  The Web of Science electronic database was searched to identify relevant papers on VR research in medicine. Basic publication and citation data were acquired using the Analyze and Create Citation Report functions of the database. Complete bibliographic data were exported to VOSviewer and Bibliometrix, dedicated bibliometric software packages, for further analyses. Visualization maps were generated to illustrate the recurring keywords and words mentioned in the titles and abstracts.  The analysis was based on data from 8399 papers. Major research themes were diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as rehabilitation. Commonly studied medical conditions were pain, stroke, anxiety, depression, fear, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Overall, contributions to the literature were globally distributed with heaviest contributions from the United States and United Kingdom. Studies from more clinically related research areas such as surgery, psychology, neurosciences, and rehabilitation had higher average numbers of citations than studies from computer sciences and engineering.  The conducted bibliometric analysis unequivocally reveals the versatile emerging applications of VR and AR in medicine. With the further maturation of the technology and improved accessibility in countries where VR and AR research is strong, we expect it to have a marked impact on clinical practice and in the life of patients.', 'Social media has been extensively used for the communication of health-related information and consecutively for the potential spread of medical misinformation. Conventional systematic reviews have been published on this topic to identify original articles and to summarize their methodological approaches and themes. A bibliometric study could complement their findings, for instance, by evaluating the geographical distribution of the publications and determining if they were well cited and disseminated in high-impact journals.  The aim of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the current literature to discover the prevalent trends and topics related to medical misinformation on social media.  The Web of Science Core Collection electronic database was accessed to identify relevant papers with the following search string: ALL=(misinformati* OR wrong informati* OR disinformati* OR misleading informati* OR fake news*) AND ALL=(medic* OR illness* OR disease* OR health* OR pharma* OR drug* OR therap*) AND ALL=(social media* OR Facebook* OR Twitter* OR Instagram* OR YouTube* OR Weibo* OR Whatsapp* OR Reddit* OR TikTok* OR WeChat*). Full records were exported to a bibliometric software, VOSviewer, to link bibliographic information with citation data. Term and keyword maps were created to illustrate recurring terms and keywords.  Based on an analysis of 529 papers on medical and health-related misinformation on social media, we found that the most popularly investigated social media platforms were Twitter (n=90), YouTube (n=67), and Facebook (n=57). Articles targeting these 3 platforms had higher citations per paper (>13.7) than articles covering other social media platforms (Instagram, Weibo, WhatsApp, Reddit, and WeChat; citations per paper <8.7). Moreover, social media platform-specific papers accounted for 44.1% (233/529) of all identified publications. Investigations on these platforms had different foci. Twitter-based research explored cyberchondria and hypochondriasis, YouTube-based research explored tobacco smoking, and Facebook-based research studied vaccine hesitancy related to autism. COVID-19 was a common topic investigated across all platforms. Overall, the United States contributed to half of all identified papers, and 80% of the top 10 most productive institutions were based in this country. The identified papers were mostly published in journals of the categories public environmental and occupational health, communication, health care sciences services, medical informatics, and medicine general internal, with the top journal being the Journal of Medical Internet Research.  There is a significant platform-specific topic preference for social media investigations on medical misinformation. With a large population of internet users from China, it may be reasonably expected that Weibo, WeChat, and TikTok (and its Chinese version Douyin) would be more investigated in future studies. Currently, these platforms present research gaps that leave their usage and information dissemination warranting further evaluation. Future studies should also include social platforms targeting non-English users to provide a wider global perspective.', 'Twitter, representing a big social media network, is broadly used for the communication of health-related information. In this work, we aimed to identify and analyze the scientific literature on Twitter use in context of health by utilizing a bibliometric approach, in order to obtain quantitative information on dominant research topics, trending themes, key publications, scientific institutions, and prolific researchers who contributed to this scientific area.  Web of Science electronic database was searched to identify relevant papers on Twitter and health. Basic bibliographic data was obtained utilizing the Analyze function of the database. Full records and cited references were exported to VOSviewer, a dedicated bibliometric software, for further analysis. A term map and a keyword map were synthesized to visualize recurring words within titles, abstracts and keywords.  The analysis was based on the data from 2,582 papers. The first papers were published in 2009, and the publication count increased rapidly since 2015. Original articles and reviews were published in a ratio of 10.6:1. The Journal of Medical Internet Research was the top journal, and the United States had contributions to over half (52%) of these publications, being the home-country of eight of the top ten most productive institutions. Keyword analysis identified six topically defined clusters, with professional education in healthcare being the top theme cluster (consisting of 66 keywords). The identified papers often investigated Twitter together with other social media, such as YouTube and Facebook.  A great diversity of themes was found in the identified papers, including: professional education in healthcare, big data and sentiment analysis, social marketing and substance use, physical and emotional well-being of young adults, and public health and health communication. Our quantitative analysis outlines Twitter as both, an increasingly popular data source, and a highly versatile tool for health-related research.']"

Epidermoid cysts of the jaw bones are extremely rare, with only several cases docu-mented in the dental literature. Their most common intraoral location is the floor of the oral cavity, the tongue, lips, palate and cheeks. They are slow-growing painless for -mations, usually discovered incidentally when imaging scans, as well as histopathological examinations, are per-formed. A patient sought assistance from us, presenting with painful swelling in the right side of the mandible, without added infection. The radiograph and the CBCT scans re-vealed a lesion in the region of tooth #48, extending half-way into the mandibular ramus, which was surgically re-moved under general anesthesia. The surgical technique was cystectomy-complete removal of the cyst with the fi-brous capsule. The mucosa above the bone defect is then tightly sealed. The histopathology report described an epi-dermal cyst. It follows that this type of lesions, though ex-tremely uncommon in the jaw bones, must be considered in the differential diagnosis with odontogenic cysts like follicular odontogeneic cyst and odontogeneic keratocyst.', 'Gingival cyst of adult is an uncommon, small, non inflammatory, extra-osseous, developmental cyst of gingiva arising from the rests of dental lamina.  The aim of our paper is to present two rare clinical cases of gingival cyst of adult. Material and methods: In the present cases, the combined anatomic characteristics of the soft tissue presentation and the osseous defect suggest that the lesion is a gingival cyst of adult. Two cases of gingival cyst were diagnosed and treated with exicisional biopsy followed by histopathological confirmation and an emphasis on the clinical aspects of this lesion.  The biopsy revealed histologic features consistent with a gingival cyst. Clinical and radiographic examinations 1 year post-surgery indicated uneventful soft tissue healing and bone fill of the initial defect.  Gingival cyst most commonly occurs on the labial side of the mandible in the canine and premolar areas. It is discrete, well-cirumscribed, painless swelling of he attached gingiva or gingival papilla. This is a soft tissue lesion, and if enlarged to sufficient size, it causes superficial erosion of the cortical plate of bone. Lesions appear to be asymptomatic and do not produce discomfort. It is a fairly rare cyst or at least it is rarely sent for biopsy.', 'Epidermoid cysts are benign lesions that occur throughout the body. Their development in the oral cavity is extremely rare. Intraosseous epidermoid cysts of the jaw are even rarer and difficult to distinguish from other lesions. For this reason, we would like to draw the attention of practitioners to this pathology as a differential diagnosis through the presented clinical case.  This study presents an unusual case of a type of epidermoid cyst in an edentulous maxilla. A 70-year-old man was referred to the Maxillofacial Surgery Division at the University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment and Emergency Medicine N. I. Pirogov, Sofia, Bulgaria, for a single radiolucent area in his anterior maxilla. The patient underwent surgery to extract the cyst.  Based on the clinical and radiographic evaluation, a preliminary diagnosis of dentigerous residual cyst was made. The histopathological examination of the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections revealed an epidermoid cyst based on the observed thick keratin layer resembling epidermis together with the stratified squamous epithelium lining with many layers of sheaves of orthokeratin.  This report presents an uncommon case of an intraosseous epidermoid cyst occurring without a history of maxillary trauma. Although intraosseous epidermoid cysts are extremely rare in jaws, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of radiolucent lesions.']"

To better understand the impact of L. iners on common cervicovaginal infections, we conducted systematic reviews of the associations between L. iners compared with L. crispatus and 8 outcomes: Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), BV, human papillomavirus, cervical dysplasia, human immunodeficiency virus, genital herpes, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. On April 30, 2021, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for epidemiologic studies of reproductive-age, nonpregnant, cisgender women that used marker gene sequencing to characterize vaginal microbiota composition and presented an effect estimate for the association between L. iners, compared with L. crispatus, and outcomes of interest. For outcomes with >= 3 eligible results presenting the same form of effect estimate, we conducted random-effects meta-analysis. The review protocol was registered prospectively (PROSPERO CRD42020214775). Six Ct studies were included in meta-analysis, which showed L. iners-dominated microbiotas were associated with 3.4-fold higher odds of Ct compared with L. crispatus-dominated microbiotas (95% confidence interval, 2.1-5.4). Three BV studies were included in meta-analysis, which indicated L. iners-dominated microbiotas were associated with 2.1-fold higher prevalence of BV compared with L. crispatus-dominated microbiotas (95% confidence interval, 0.9-4.9). Evidence was too sparse to perform meta-analysis for the remaining outcomes. L. iners-dominated vaginal microbiotas may be suboptimal compared with L. crispatus-dominated microbiotas for BV and Ct.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of BV in Bulgarian pregnant and nonpregnant women from several age ranges and to compare three different laboratory methods for Gardnerella vaginalis detection in patents suffering from BV.  Between September 2011 and June 2012, 809 women of 16-40 years of age separated in two major groups: nonpregnant -469 (355 with and 114 without symptoms) and pregnant - 340 (213 and 127 respectively) were enrolled for the study. The women underwent three different laboratory tests simultaneously: scoring of Gramstaining of vaginal smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for G. vaginalis.  The microscopic method detected high frequency of BV in symptomatic (57%) whereas only a minority of asymptomatic subjects (14%) were detected. G. vaginalis associated BV was diagnosed in approximately equal proportions when evaluated with PCR and microscopic method for both pregnant and nonpregnant women. The comparative analysis of microscopic evaluation, culture and PCR assays demonstrated greater concurrence (about 90%) between Gram staining and PCR detection for BV, than both methods compared to culture. The combination of microscopy and PCR turned out to be very reliable and repeatable for detecting G. vaginalis-associated BV.  This is the first comparative investigation on the epidemiology of G. vaginalis-associated BV in Bulgaria. The established highest frequency in the young Bulgarian women (21-30 years) is alarming and should be considered in prophylaxis and reproductive programmes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

ReSTORE was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised phase 3 trial done at 66 tertiary care centres in 15 countries. Adults (>= 18 years) with systemic signs and mycological confirmation of candidaemia or invasive candidiasis were eligible for inclusion and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous rezafungin once a week (400 mg in week 1, followed by 200 mg weekly, for a total of two to four doses) or intravenous caspofungin (70 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 50 mg daily) for no more than 4 weeks. The primary endpoints were global cure (consisting of clinical cure, radiological cure, and mycological eradication) at day 14 for the European Medical Agency (EMA) and 30-day all-cause mortality for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), both with a target non-inferiority margin of 20%, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all patients who received one or more doses of study drug and had documented Candida infection based on a culture from blood or another normally sterile site obtained within 96 h before randomisation). Safety was evaluated by the incidence and type of adverse events and deaths in the safety population, defined as all patients who received any amount of study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03667690, and is complete. Findings Between Oct 12, 2018, and Aug 29, 2021, 222 patients were screened for inclusion, and 199 patients (118 [59%] men; 81 [41%] women; mean age 61 years [SD 15middot2]) were randomly assigned (100 [50%] patients to the rezafungin group and 99 [50%] patients to the caspofungin group). 55 (59%) of 93 patients in the rezafungin group and 57 (61%) of 94 patients in the caspofungin group had a global cure at day 14 (weighted treatment difference -1middot1% [95% CI - 14middot9 to 12middot7]; EMA primary endpoint). 22 (24%) of 93 patients in the rezafungin group and 20 (21%) of 94 patients in the caspofungin group died or had an unknown survival status at day 30 (treatment difference 2middot4% [95% CI - 9middot7 to 14middot4]; FDA primary endpoint). In the safety analysis, 89 (91%) of 98 patients in the rezafungin group and 83 (85%) of 98 patients in the caspofungin group had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either group were pyrexia, hypokalaemia, pneumonia, septic shock, and anaemia. 55 (56%) patients in the rezafungin group and 52 (53%) patients in the caspofungin group had serious adverse events. Interpretation Our data show that rezafungin was non-inferior to caspofungin for the primary endpoints of day-14 global cure (EMA) and 30-day all-cause mortality (FDA). Efficacy in the initial days of treatment warrants evaluation. There were no concerning trends in treatment-emergent or serious adverse events. These phase 3 results show the efficacy and safety of rezafungin and support its ongoing development.']"

MDDM was performed with disks containing metronidazole (5 mu g), clarithromycin (15 mu g) or erythromycin (15 mu g), ciprofloxacin (5 mu g) and tetracycline (30 mu g). Resistance was determined by an inhibitory zone of <16 mm for metronidazole and less than or equal to 30 mm for other agents tested. The cut-off concentrations used to define resistance by SAM were: metronidazole >8mg/L, clarithromycin >2mg/L, tetracycline >4 mg/L and ciprofloxacin >1 mg/L, Primary resistance rates in H. pylori were: metronidazole 28,6%, clarithromycin 9,7%, metronidazole + clarithromycin 2,8%, ciprofloxacin 3,9%, metronidazole + ciprofloxacin 2,3%, tetracycline 1.9% and metronidazole + tetracycline 1,2%, Among metronidazole-resistant isolates, combined resistance to clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was present in 11.4% (5 of 44 strains), 8.3% (3 of 36) and 4.9% (2 of 41), respectively.

Antral specimens from children with chronic gastritis (n=513), peptic ulcers (n=54) and other diseases (n=91) were evaluated by direct Gram staining (DGS), in-house rapid urease test (RUT) and culture. The living environment and semi-quantitative H. pylori density were assessed in 188 and 328 children, respectively. H. pylori infection was found in children with ulcers (77.8 %), chronic gastritis (64.5 %) and other diseases (36.3 %). Half (51.4 %) of patients aged 1 -5 years and 77.4 % of those aged 16-17 years were H. pylori-positive. Of all children, 328 (49.8 %) showed positive DGS, 184 (28 %) had a positive RUT, and 386 (58.7 %) were culture-positive. Unlike gastric mucus specimens, frozen biopsy specimens provided reliable diagnosis. H. heilmannii was observed in two (0.3 %) children. High H. pylori density (growth into all quadrants of plates) was found in 18 % of 328 children evaluated, involving 31 % of ulcer and 16.7 % of non-ulcer patients. H. pylori infection was more common in rural children with chronic gastritis (91.3 %) than in the remainder (66.7 %). In conclusion, H. pylori infection was common in symptomatic Bulgarian children. The infection prevalence was >77 % in patients aged 16-17 years, in children with a duodenal ulcer, and in rural patients. H. heilmannii infection was uncommon. The performance of the bacterial culture was good. The impact of H. pylori density on the clinical expression and eradication of the infection requires further evaluation. The results highlight the need for routine H. pylori diagnosis in rural children with chronic gastritis.', ""Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common bacterial infection worldwide and one of the main etiological factors of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and stomach neoplasms. The mass application of antibiotics without testing, especially during the last years of the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, could lead to a dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance and reduced effectiveness of eradication regimens for H. pylori infection. The epidemiology of H. pylori resistance to antibiotics still has unclear mechanisms. Antibiotic policy should be intensified to optimize treatment, and regular monitoring of resistance of H. pylori in different geographical regions should be conducted. Individualized treatment according to susceptibility testing is strongly advisable, and the best treatment regimens should be selected. The mutations in the genes encoding the antibiotic target protein are significant risk factors for H. pylori resistance. Iatrogenic errors in diagnosis and prescribing treatment for the failure of H. pylori eradication are other important risk factors. The low level of awareness and compliance with the correct treatment influence the rate of H. pylori resistance. Epidemiological surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the adoption of new treatment strategies are needed. The discovery of an efficient vaccine against H. pylori could reduce the pressure of the world's growing antibiotic resistance.""]"

DF is result of radiative deactivation of secondary excited chlorophyll molecules in Photosystem II (PS II) antennae complexes. The excitations are produced by backward electron-transfer reactions both in the donor and acceptor sides of PS II. The poly-exponential dark decay of DF in a time interval of tens of nanoseconds to tens of seconds reflects the kinetics of different forward and backward reactions of the photosynthetic electron transfer. The current work reviews the mechanisms of the DF light quanta generation and the methodical approaches that allow us to obtain quantitative information about the photosynthetic machinery state using the DF signal from native objects. We examine an approach for the simultaneous record of DF and prompt chlorophyll fluorescence during the transition of the photosynthetic machinery from dark-adapted to light-adapted state. A new device (Senior PEA) built by Hansatech (King's Lynn, UK) allows us to measure simultaneously the induction transients of prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, DF decaying in a time range 10 mu s - 240 ms, and the changes in transmission at 820 nm. The comparative analysis of the three types of signals and the application of a model-based description of the processes and reactions that determine the dynamics of the signals during the light-induced transitions (dynamic models and JIP-test) allow us to obtain, from a single few-seconds-long measurement, quantitative information for: a) energetic fluxes and efficiencies at different steps of energy transformation; b) rate constants of electron transfer in and between the two photosystems; c) energization of the thylakoid membrane. This illustrates that DF in combination with other optical and luminescent measurements is a highly informative method for investigation of the physiological state of the photosynthetic apparatus of plants in vivo and in situ, and is an indispensable tool for the purposes of the biophysical phenomics."", 'The herbal plant Salvia sclarea L. (clary sage) is classified to cadmium (Cd) accumulators and considered as a potential plant for phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soil. However, the effect of Cd only treatment on the function of the photosynthetic apparatus of S. sclarea, as well as the mechanisms involved in Cd tolerance have not yet been studied in detail. This study was conducted to examine the integrative responses of S. sclarea plants exposed to a high Cd supply (100 mu M) for 3 and 8 days by investigating element nutrient uptake, oxidative stress markers, pigment composition, photosynthetic performance and leaf structure. Measurements of the functional activities of photosystem I (PSI, by P700 photooxidation), photosystem II (PSII, by chlorophyll fluorescence parameters), the oxygen-evolving complex (oxygen evolution by Joliotand Clark-type electrodes), as well as the leaf pigment and phenolic contents, were used to evaluate the protective mechanisms of the photosynthetic apparatus under Cd stress. Data suggested that the molecular mechanisms included in the photosynthetic tolerance to Cd toxicity involve strongly increased phenolic and anthocyanin contents, as well as an increased non-photochemical quenching and accelerated cyclic electron transport around PSI up to 61%, which protect the function of the photosynthetic apparatus under stress. Furthermore, the tolerance of S. sclarea to Cd stress is also associated with increased accumulation of Fe in leaves by 25%. All the above, clearly suggest that S. sclarea plants employ several different mechanisms to protect the function of the photosynthetic apparatus against Cd stress, which are discussed here.', 'Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) have recently been attracting the attention of plant biologists as a prospective tool for modulation of photosynthesis in higher plants. However, the exact mode of action of SWCNT on the photosynthetic electron transport chain remains unknown. In this work, we examined the effect of foliar application of polymer-grafted SWCNT on the donor side of photosystem II, the intersystem electron transfer chain and the acceptor side of photosystem I. Analysis of the induction curves of chlorophyll fluorescence via JIP test and construction of differential curves revealed that SWCNT concentrations up to 100 mg/L did not affect the photosynthetic electron transport chain. SWCNT concentration of 300 mg/L had no effect on the photosystem II donor side but provoked inactivation of photosystem II reaction centres and slowed down the reduction of the plastoquinone pool and the photosystem I end acceptors. Changes in the modulated reflection at 820 nm, too, indicated slower re-reduction of photosystem I reaction centres in SWCNT-treated leaves. We conclude that SWCNT are likely to be able to divert electrons from the photosynthetic electron transport chain at the level of photosystem I end acceptors and plastoquinone pool in vivo. Further research is needed to unequivocally prove if the observed effects are due to specific interaction between SWCNT and the photosynthetic apparatus.']"

Choosing a panel of cytokines crucial for Th17/Treg differentiation and behavior, in colon specimens, as mRNA biomarkers, and their serum protein levels. We found a significant difference between higher gene expression of FoxP3, TGFb1, IL-10, and IL-23, and approximately equal level of IL-6 in CRC patients in comparison with IBD patients. After stratification of CRC patients, we found a significant difference in FoxP3, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-17A mRNA in early cases compared to IBD, and IL-23 alone in advanced CRC. The protein levels of the cytokines were significantly higher in CRC patients compared to IBD patients. Our findings showed that IL-6 upregulation is essential for both IBD and CRC development until the upregulation of other Th17/Treg related genes (TGFb1, IL-10, IL-23, and transcription factor FoxP3) is a crucial primarily for CRC development.

The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression of interleukin 12A (IL-12A), IL-12B, IL-23A, IL-10, IL-6, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), HDAC3, and iNOS in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Material and methods: The venous blood for PBMC isolation was collected preoperatively and 10 days after surgery, from CRC patients. After isolation of total RNA and synthesis of cDNA, quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed.  Our results demonstrated that among investigated cytokine genes IL-10 and TGF-b were significantly upregulated in patients with CRC compared to the control group, while the expression of IL-23 mRNA was significantly decreased in CRC patients. We observed significantly increased mRNA levels in CRC patients' PBMC before surgery for IL-10 and TGF-b compared to both postoperative and control groups. We also found a significant upregulation of iNOS in early compared to advanced CRC.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine with a pleiotropic effect on CRC development. We aimed to evaluate IL-6 expression in tumor cells and in immune cells in TME, to assess the serum level and IL6 -174 G/C genotype distribution and to correlate the results with selected morphologic and clinical parameters that may add useful information in understanding the mechanisms of human CRC progression. A total of 153 patients with CRC were recruited in the current study. We assessed the IL-6 serum concentration through the ELISA method, the expression of IL-6 in tumor and in immune cells by immunohistochemical and double immunofluorescence staining, the MSI status by immun & ocy;histochemistry for 4 mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, and the genotype distributions for IL6 -174G/C (rs1800795) single-nucleotide polymorphism through PCR-RFLP method. Our results showed that serum IL-6 level were increased in CRC patients as compared with healthy controls (P<0.0001), and in patients with cancers with advanced histologic type (type IV). However, the higher concentration (above the median of 55.71 pg/mL) was with borderline association with longer survival of the patients after surgical therapy (P=0.055, Log rank test). We also found that IL-6+ immune cells prevailed in the invasive front (IF) of tumors compared with the tumor stroma (TS) (P<0.0001). More IL-6+ cells were recruited in the tumors with less advanced histologic type (I+II), with stronger inflammatory infiltrate in the IF, in early pTNM stages (I+II), without lymph node and distant metastases and the higher levels of IL-6+ cells, especially in the IF, were associated with longer survival (P=0.012). The results of our study suggest that although the serum levels of IL-6 are higher in CRC, the increased IL-6+ cells in tumor microenvironment, both in the invasive front and in tumor stroma, as well as the higher serum levels are associated with good prognostic variables and longer survival of the patients mainly in the early stages of CRC.']"

Materials and  A representative sample of 132 patients from three tertiary hospitals in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria was collected. Anthropometric measurements were linked to global noise annoyance (GNA) based on different residential noise annoyances, day-evening-night (L-den), and nighttime (L-night) road traffic noise exposure. Noise map L-den and L-night were determined at the living room and bedroom facades, respectively, and further corrected to indoor exposure based on the window-opening frequency and soundproofing insulation. and Discussion: showed that BMI and WC increased (non-significantly) per 5 dB. The effect of indoor noise was stronger in comparison with that of outdoor noise. For indoor L-den, the effect was more pronounced in men, those with diabetes, family history of diabetes, high noise sensitivity, using solid fuel/gas for domestic heating/cooking, and living on the first floor. As regards indoor L-night, its effect was more pronounced in those with low socioeconomic status, hearing loss, and using solid fuel/gas for domestic heating/cooking. GNA was associated with lower BMI and WC.  Road traffic noise was associated with an increase in adiposity in some potentially vulnerable patients with CVD.', 'Road traffic noise is a widely studied environmental risk factor for ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in particular. Given that myocardial infarction is a leading disability and mortality cause in Bulgaria and that a significant proportion of the urban population is exposed to high noise levels, quantification of the burden of disease attributable to traffic noise is essential for environmental health policy making and noise control engineering. This study aimed at estimating the burden of the myocardial infarction cases attributable to road traffic noise in the Bulgarian urban population. We used the methodology for estimating the burden of disease attributable to environmental noise outlined by the World Health Organization. Risk data were extracted from a recently published meta-analysis providing updated exposureresponse relationship between traffic noise and the risk for myocardial infarction. Based on these data we calculated the fraction of myocardial infarction cases attributable to traffic noise, loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the economic burden, assuming (sic) 12,000 per QALY. About 2.9 % or 101 of all myocardial infarction cases could be attributed to road traffic noise. Fifty-five of these were fatal. Nine hundred and sixty-eight QALYs were lost to these cases. The monetary value of these QALYs was about (sic) 11.6 million. Although the measures used in this study are crude and give only an approximation of the real burden of disease from road traffic noise, they are indicative of the important social and economic aspect of noise pollution in Bulgaria. Hopefully, these results will direct the attention of epidemiologists, environmental hygienists, and health economists to this pivotal environmental issue.', 'Traffic noise is an established risk factor for some cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and ischaemic heart disease, but the evidence regarding stroke is still limited. In this study we aimed to systematically review the related epidemiological data and make a meta-analysis of the risk of stroke morbidity associated with road and air traffic noise exposure. We searched articles in English, Spanish, and Russian indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar on 24 November 2015. Qualitative synthesis was made for 13 studies, and 11 studies were included in quality effects meta-analyses. Overall, they were of high quality. Based on six studies (n approximate to 8,790,671 participants) for road traffic noise, we found a pooled relative risk (RR) of stroke per 10 dB to be 1.01 (95 % CI: 0.96, 1.06). In the 70-75 dB noise range (versus <55 dB) RR increased to 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.74, 2.24). For air traffic noise we pooled five studies (n approximate to 16,132,075 participants) and the RR (per 10 dB) was1.01 (95 % CI: 1.00, 1.02). Road traffic group showed high heterogeneity whereas the air traffic group had none. Both groups showed evidence of publication bias. In conclusion, we have established a small but elevated risk of stroke to be associated with both road and air traffic noise exposure, but the association was statistically significant only with the latter. The effect of road traffic noise followed a non-linear trend.']"

Variations in its anatomy can alter the nerve supply to the upper extremity. Such deviations are clinically important, as they can change the symptomatology of various pathologic conditions, leading to misdiagnosis, inadequate treatment, and surgical failures as a consequence.Materials and  The upper limbs of 16 human cadavers (32 extremities) were dissected at the Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Medical University-Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Eight cadavers were male and eight female, with age ranging 40-95 years (mean age: 72.63 years). Three variations (18.8%) were identified unilaterally, exclusively in male cadavers; however, no statistically significant sex-based distribution was observed. The first variation involved a communicating branch between the musculocutaneous nerve and median nerve. The second was a high bifurcation of the radial nerve in the axillary fossa into two divisions. The third one was a communicating branch between the axillary nerve and the radial nerve, forming a loop beneath the subscapular artery. Our study identified greater variability in the branches of the posterior cord compared to the existing literature. These variations must be taken under clinical consideration to prevent diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical errors.', 'A reoperation for a cubital tunnel syndrome is not uncommon. Patients often complain of sensorimotor symptoms in the ulnar nerve distribution after their primary surgery. The documented etiologies for such a phenomenon include a new kinking of the distal ulnar nerve and a new compression of the ulnar nerve by the fascial septum in between or tendinous bands over the muscles of the forearm. The deep fascial plane along which the ulnar nerve travels in the forearm has had scant attention. We present an anatomical study to provide a better understanding of such etiologies to aid physicians in performing successful primary ulnar nerve release that does not lead to risky reoperations and ultimately yields improved patient satisfaction. Materials and methods The forearms of 12 fresh frozen cadavers (24 arms) underwent dissection, during which the fascial relationships between the ulnar nerve and muscles of the anterior compartment were explored with a blunt technique. The relationship between the fascial planes and the ulnar nerve was quantitatively and qualitatively documented. The ranges of motion of the elbow were also observed for any potential compression points on the nerve during the movement. In all specimens (n = 24), the ulnar nerve entered the forearm between the humeral and ulnar heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, after which it routed deep to a deep fascia between the anterior surface of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the posterior surface of the flexor digitorum superficialis. Ulnar nerve branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris pierced this fascial septum while en route to the posterior surface of the muscle. Medially, the branches to the flexor digitorum profundus also pierced this fascial plane. In most arms, the fascia became thinner near the junction between the proximal two-thirds and distal one-third of the forearm. On no side was the ulnar nerve found to be grossly compressed by this deep fascia. However, with the extension of the elbow, a degree of angulation of the proximal ulnar nerve was observed due to its compact connection with the deep fascia. Our study revealed that there is an intimate relationship between the ulnar nerve and the deep fascia of the forearm. Since the ulnar branches to the overlying flexor carpi ulnaris pierce this deep structure, a care should be given to its anatomical course during surgery in this region to prevent denervation of the muscle.', 'PurposeAnterior compartment muscles of the arm present high morphological variability, with possible clinical significance.

The 2,3-dihydroxy, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy, and syringaldehyde derivatives of 5MICA exhibited the strongest neuroprotection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells and 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in rat-brain synaptosomes.

A small series of benzimidazole derivatives containing hydroxy and methoxy arylhydrazone fragments has been synthesized and the neurotoxicity of the compounds has been evaluated in vitro on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and on isolated rat brain synaptosomes by measuring the cell viability and the levels of reduced glutathione and a good safety profile has been shown.

The neuroprotective properties of the test compounds were further assessed using two models: H2O2-induced oxidative stress on SH-SY5Y cells and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity in rat brain synaptosomes. Compound 7 showed more pronounced neuroprotective activity on SH-SY5Y cells, compared to the referent melatonin and rasagiline.

All the tested compounds were capable to inhibit human monoamine oxidase-B enzyme to a significant extent, however, compound 7 exerted the most prominent inhibitory activity, similar to selegiline and rasagiline. The carried out molecular docking studies revealed that the activity is related to the appropriate molecular structure enabling the ligand to enter deeper in the narrow and highly lipophylic active site pocket of the human monoamine oxidase-B and has a favoring interaction with the key amino acid residues Tyr326 and Cys172. Since much scientific evidence points out the implication of iron dyshomeostasis in PD, the compounds were tested to reduce the ferrous iron induced oxidative molecular damage on biologically important molecules in an in vitro lecithin containing model system. All the investigated compounds denoted protection effect, stronger than the one of the referent melatonin. In order to support the assignments of the significant neuroprotective and antioxidant pharmacological activities, the radical-scavenging mechanisms of the most promising compound 7 were evaluated using DFT methods. It was found that the most probable free radicals scavenging mechanism in nonpolar phase is the hydrogen atom transfer from the amide group of compound 7, while in polar medium the process is expected to occur by a proton transfer.
